2025-04-19_762167,Trump Just Scrapped My Anti-Kremlin Streaming Platform,We called it Votvot — Russian for “any minute now.”,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/opinion/trump-defund-votvot-kremlin-russia.html,2025-04-19 11:00:18,"Guest Essay Mr. Idov co-founded Votvot, which was recently defunded by the American government. The Trump administration’s decision to take a hammer to the funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty might be legally dubious, but politically pretty safe: Its programming wasn’t intended to reach American audiences, so who would miss it, really? In September 2022, I came to Prague, in an unusual role of a volunteer media expert, to observe the operations of the Russian-language TV channel and online news portal, Current Time — one of the many brands under the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty umbrella. An American from Latvia whose native language is Russian, I had spent much of the previous decade trying to build bridges between the U.S. and Russian TV industries, a dream wiped out overnight with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Current Time had become an indispensable source of news for an audience misled by their own state media. Six months in, war coverage had pushed out almost all other reporting and fatigue was setting in. I wanted to be useful. If my knowledge of the Russian media could somehow help Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, I was happy to share it. Not to mention the fact that, as a lifelong fan of the band R.E.M., I’d never pass up a chance to visit the organization that helped inspire their debut single, “Radio Free Europe.” The organization’s headquarters was an imposing gray cube, just east of the city center. The general aura reminded me of a U.S. Embassy. It might be an editorially independent nongovernment entity, but its cultural and literal footprint was always that of an American values bulwark. I soon found I had landed in the middle of a philosophical debate. Would showing anything other than atrocities constitute catering to Russia? At the time of my arrival, the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty staff was considering starting a second channel that would run hard-hitting documentaries about Russian history and cruelties. I wondered who would be the audience for such depressing programming. A better tactic, I thought, would be to try to appeal to the persuadables, an audience many of whom had tuned out watching the news but retained a sense of right and wrong; an audience that Alexei Navalny, Russia’s opposition leader, had sacrificed his freedom — and, soon, his life — trying to reach. The walls of the headquarters were lined not only with photos of the likes of Henry Kissinger and Hillary Clinton, but also Duke Ellington and Tom Jones. Indeed, the older generation of Soviet citizens retained warm memories of the “enemy voices” (as Radio Liberty, Voice of America, and the BBC’s Russian Service were known) not because they delivered news from the West, but because they’d play jazz and rock ’n’ roll. Pop culture was the draw. I went back to the hotel and wrote out an email positing just that: What are the new areas of cultural scarcity? What have censorship and militarism taken away from the average young Russian? Some answers: uncensored stand-up comedy, freewheeling talk shows with no verboten topics and music by artists who hold opposition views. (Some, like my acquaintance, the rapper Ivan Dremin, a.k.a. FACE, were even declared “foreign agents.”) This initiative would also serve a secondary purpose. Since the start of the war, hundreds of thousands of Russia’s most promising and conscientious citizens had left the country, many forgoing their careers in the process. This new platform I imagined could provide a lifeline to the artists among them and a diversion for the rest. And it should be a streaming and video-on-demand platform, functioning as a site, a mobile app, and a production hub using the artists’ own YouTube channels for distribution. It turned out that someone at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty had been harboring a very similar vision. That someone was Stephen Capus, former president of NBC News and adviser to the United States Agency for Global Media, who had recently come onboard to consult for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Within weeks, we had written a proposal for this new media brand. It was approved almost instantly. It also created a fissure among the staff members, some of whom balked at “entertaining Russians.” My volunteer effort became a job. The platform began in April 2023. Its earliest offerings included a concert film by FACE (naturally), who alternated hedonistic raps with serious statements and at some point unfurled a Ukrainian flag; a stand-up set by Ariana Lolaeva, a rising comedian from North Ossetia who had a criminal case against her back in Russia; music by Boris Grebenshchikov, a rock ’n’ roll veteran with a Bob Dylan-like stature; and a Ukrainian documentary series about animals in war, anchored by Patron, the famous mine-sniffing dog. The last one, oddly enough, made the most important statement of all. It was one of the first instances of a Ukrainian collaboration with a Russophone media brand since the start of the war. Its very existence thus proclaimed two things: that a state was not its people, and that a Russian cultural platform could be unbound not only to Vladimir Putin but even to the Russian language. The name we picked for the service was Votvot. In Russian, the phrase “vot-vot” means both enthusiastic agreement, akin to “exactly” or the German “genau,” and something like “any minute now,” which some chose to read as a cheeky prediction of systemic change. The platform had an unofficial motto: “If the Kremlin hates it, we have it.” There is, certainly, room for discussion on whether financing foreign-facing media is a proper use of U.S. taxpayer money. In order to have this discussion in good faith, however, it’s necessary to establish what kind of money we’re talking about. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s entire annual operating budget in 2024 was $142 million, which covered a staff of more than 1,700 and services reaching 47 million weekly users in 27 languages. Votvot cost around $2 million a year, including all content and salaries. (For context, this is about 1/9000th of Netflix’s projected content budget this year). The Votvot team consisted of far-flung freelancers in places including Tbilisi, Georgia; Barcelona, Spain; Belgrade, Serbia; and Berlin. Several of them worked from Ukraine. We had more than a few editorial meetings from which someone had to excuse themselves early to head to a bomb shelter. One young woman was still in Moscow at the time of her hiring. I was gingerly explaining the risks of working with “foreign agents” over a Zoom when she lifted her hand into the frame to adjust her hair. Her fingernails were painted the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. Here, I knew, was someone utterly fearless. Within a few months, the job allowed her to leave Russia. On Feb. 20, 2024, the Russian authorities declared all of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty an “undesirable organization.” This designation was an escalation from “foreign agent” and just below “extremist organization.” (Instagram is also seen as extremist.) This meant that it was now illegal to share or comment on the content. Imagine trying to go viral when your viewers might be fined or jailed for pressing “like.” Worried about the safety of both our creators and our audience, we put up new content without advertising it.  As time went by and the war dragged on, the chasm between the Russians who stayed and the Russians who left kept growing. Many of those on the inside began to think of the ones on the outside as privileged and out of touch. A common critique of all media projects headquartered abroad is that this is just the diaspora talking to itself. Yet only those outside of Mr. Putin’s reach could sing, play or joke without being censored or censoring themselves. Votvot launched its first proper publicity campaign in September 2024. At that point, the content streaming on its platform included the Oscar-winning documentary “20 Days in Mariupol,” to which it held rights in 15 countries, and dozens of exclusive films, concerts and shows. Two months later, the United States restored Donald Trump to the presidency. Soon after his inauguration, Trump realigned America’s policies towards both Russia and Ukraine, and also decided the service is no longer worth paying for. It’s reasonable to infer that the real issue, in the administration’s eyes, is probably not the cost of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s programming, but what they called its far-left values (this, about an organization whose entire existence is based on fighting Communism). Starting on April 1, about half of its employees have been furloughed, freelancers dismissed and the Votvot experiment frozen. At the end, it had well over a million unique users. The satellite services that broadcast its programs to Russia were turned off on April 4. Mr. Capus, who had become the organization’s president in January 2024, is spearheading the effort to save its funding. But it’s not just the consumers of our content that have lost. Having worked for an “enemy,” many of the creators could face repercussions at home, and their ability to stay abroad is often dependent on their employment-based visa status. Some are probably safe in Spain and Germany; others are in Georgia and Serbia, countries that could very well be more susceptible to Russian influence. For a short while we were able to empower fearless creators to speak up against war and push back against censorship. Some may see this as government waste. I happen to see it as a smart investment in a generation that will one day run a post-Putin Russia — and is instead learning a lesson in American duplicity.

Reporting from Toronto When Canadians vote in parliamentary elections on April 28, they will essentially be choosing between two starkly different candidates to lead their country through a crisis brought on by President Trump’s tariffs and festering economic and social issues. Mark Carney, 60, the Liberal Party leader who has been serving as prime minister since early March, is a political novice. He has had a long career in central banking and global finance. Pierre Poilievre, 45, the Conservative Party leader, has been a politician for most of his adult life and is well known to voters, having meticulously curated his agenda, talking points and image. Two other candidates are vying to maintain their parties’ representation in Parliament: Jagmeet Singh of the New Democrats, a leftist party that has focused much of its campaign on health care, and Yves-François Blanchet of the Bloc Québécois, which runs candidates only in Quebec. But Mr. Poilievre and Mr. Carney are widely acknowledged to be the only two who can gain enough support to become prime minister. Mr. Carney is a former central banker who made his first foray into politics by winning the support of Liberal Party members to replace Justin Trudeau as the party’s leader last month.

Then Came ‘The Shrouds’,The acclaimed filmmaker discusses bringing death to the forefront in his latest picture.,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/movies/david-cronenberg-interview.html,2025-04-19 09:01:13,"What to Watch  The acclaimed filmmaker discusses bringing death to the forefront in his latest picture.  The acclaimed filmmaker discusses bringing death to the forefront in his latest picture. Credit... In 2017, during the funeral of his wife and longtime collaborator Carolyn Zeifman, the director David Cronenberg found himself struck by an unusual impulse: As the coffin holding her dead body was lowered into the ground, he wanted more than anything to get into that box with her. That reluctance to let go is taken to even more morbid extremes in Cronenberg’s new movie, “The Shrouds,” about a high-tech cemetery where the ongoing decomposition of a corpse can be viewed through a video livestream meant for the loved ones left behind. When those graves are mysteriously vandalized, it’s up to the cemetery owner Karsh (Vincent Cassel) to determine the culprits, who he suspects may have something to do with the death of his own wife (Diane Kruger). The 82-year-old Cronenberg has always been guided by a unique point of view as a filmmaker, and his classics like “Scanners,” “Videodrome” and “The Fly” helped establish the body-horror genre. Still, he admitted in an interview via Zoom this month that “The Shrouds” could be considered one of his most personal films: It’s not for nothing that Cassel is costumed to look like his director, donning dark suits and teasing his gray hair upward in a familiar manner. Even so, Cronenberg cautioned against drawing too many links between himself and his lead character. “As soon as you start to write a screenplay, you’re writing fiction, no matter what the impetus was in your own life,” Cronenberg said. “Suddenly, you’re creating characters that need to come to life. And when you start to write them, they start to push you around if they’re really alive.” Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

In the house group chat, usually a scroll of memes, reminders and dinner plans, one of Jack Kankiewicz’s roommates dropped a screenshot of an article about President Trump’s tariffs to global trading partners announced on April 2. Mr. Kankiewicz and his roommates debated the tariffs’ possible effects, and then returned to their usual discussions, with one roommate confirming that they would indeed be getting McDonald’s before seeing “A Minecraft Movie.” Previously, tariffs were something Mr. Kankiewicz might only expect to hear from his friends majoring in political science. But since Mr. Trump’s announcement, he said, it has entered his everyday lexicon. “My roommates and I have been tapping in a little more,” said Mr. Kankiewicz, 22. He realized he didn’t have a full understanding of tariffs, so he did some internet research to figure out how they might affect him, finding speculation on the rising prices of goods and a worsening job market.

They saw their families go through the 2008 financial crisis in elementary and middle school, then the Covid pandemic in high school and college.

Sandra and Tom Johnson were at home in Los Angeles County one January night, watching the news of the Palisades fire on television, when a neighbor knocked on the door. He wanted them to see it: flames in the mountains in nearby Eaton Canyon. Within the hour, firefighters ordered the Johnsons to leave their home in the community of Altadena. “We just had to forget our stuff, grab our dog and run,” said Ms. Johnson, 72, a retired mail truck driver for the Los Angeles Unified School District. The couple sped off while fire consumed their home of 49 years, as well as the yard studded with fruit trees and vegetable patches that Mr. Johnson, 76, had meticulously tended. They went to their daughter’s house in Palmdale, an hour north, and almost four months later, they’re still there. As they contemplate their next move, one thing feels clear: They are not going back and rebuilding. It’s a particularly fraught calculation for those 50 and older. “It’s too hard at this age to wait years and years and years to be back to normal,” Ms. Johnson said. Over the course of one short week, the Palisades fire, on the west side of Los Angeles County, and the Eaton fire, on the east side, destroyed more than 16,000 structures and damaged over 2,000 more, according to the state. Not counted in that tally are homes the blaze skirted, but are still uninhabitable because of smoke damage and a lack of utilities. That translates to tens of thousands of households trying rebuild or sell at a time when federal tariff and immigration policies could make constructing homes more complicated and expensive.

In the past few years, as labor costs have grown after two strikes, producers of reality shows, scrappy indie movies and blockbuster films have increasingly turned away from Los Angeles to filming locations overseas. Those business decisions have considerable consequences for the industry’s thousands of middle-class workers: the camera operators, set decorators and lighting technicians who make movies and television happen. Frustration has reached a boiling point, according to more than two dozen people who make their living in the entertainment industry. They say that nothing short of Hollywood, as we know it, is at stake. “This is an existential crisis — it’s an extinction event,” said Beau Flynn, a producer of big-budget movies like “San Andreas,” which despite being about an earthquake in California was filmed mostly in Australia. “These are real things. I am not a dramatist, even though I’m in the drama field.” Productions have been filmed outside the United States for decades, but rarely has Hollywood work been so bustling overseas at a time when work in Hollywood itself has been so scant. Studios in European countries are bursting at the seams, industry workers say. And film and television production in Los Angeles is down by more than one-third over the past 10 years, according to FilmLA data. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

2025-04-19_369291,Many Have Tried to Fix Penn Station. Can Trump Get the Job Done?,Transportation experts say a thorough renovation is likely to take several years to complete — unless emergency measures are employed.,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/nyregion/trump-penn-station.html,2025-04-19 07:00:27,"Transportation experts say a thorough renovation is likely to take several years to complete — unless emergency measures are employed. Political leaders in New York have been promising an overhaul of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan for so long that the saga has started to resemble the Arthurian legend of the sword in the stone. One by one, officials have tried to pull off ambitious renovation schemes, and one by one they have failed. On Thursday, President Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, joined the list. Asserting federal control of the station in a surprise announcement, he vowed to transform it into a safe, clean station that “reflects America’s greatness.” In all the years of political wrangling, consensus building and master planning, the many obstacles to a new Penn Station have never been challenged so directly by the power of a president. Nor has anyone tried the strong-arm tactics that have defined the first few months of Mr. Trump’s second term. Now, Mr. Trump’s methods — aggressive demands, bullying, bluster, disregard for legal and bureaucratic structures — will be put to the test against a problem that has for years been mired in a tangle of political cross-pressures and conflicting priorities. Transportation experts say that under normal circumstances, a thorough renovation of the nation’s busiest transit hub, which serves three different railroads, would most likely take several years and cost several billion dollars. This isn’t China, where a rail station can be upgraded seemingly overnight, they say. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

It was after 9 p.m. on a recent Wednesday inside the atrium of a sleek glass office building in Midtown Manhattan, and Jacky Yu let out a scream. She and six other people were playing One Night Ultimate Werewolf — a card game in which players have secret roles and use deduction skills to discover each other’s hidden identities — and there had just been a big reveal. “We got really excited,” Ms. Yu, 31, said. The room was buzzing. Hundreds of people had gathered for an evening of game playing. Every table was occupied by clusters of people leaning in, laughing and competing. New York can be expensive, overwhelming and intimidating, and sometimes it is hard for people to connect. A martini can cost $25 in a bar that’s too noisy for conversation, and raucous nightclubs aren’t for everyone. So a free, monthly B.Y.O.B. (bring your own board game) night in an office building food court has become a big hit. In addition to Werewolf, people were playing classics, like chess and mahjong, but also relatively newer games, including Catan, Splendor, Hues and Cues, Saboteur, Nertz, Wavelength, Blokus and Camel Up.

Patricia Mazzei reported from Miami; Andrew Pantazi from Tallahassee, Fla.; and Kate Selig and Christina Morales from New York. The 20-year-old student accused of killing two people and wounding six others at Florida State University had expressed extremist political views that made classmates uncomfortable, talked about his interest in guns and experienced years of family tumult that culminated in his changing his name in high school. The day after the shooting terrorized Florida State students, forcing them to flee or hide from gunfire at the university’s campus in Tallahassee, interviews and extensive court records offered an early portrait of the suspect, though law enforcement officials remained silent on what might have motivated the attack. “All I wanted for him was a loving environment,” his biological mother, Anne-Mari Eriksen, said on Friday in a brief interview, in which she was clearly upset. “I was always concerned about his mental health and happiness.” She said she remained bewildered by the shooting and had been against the presence of firearms in her son’s life. “I feel bad for the people at F.S.U.,” she said. “My heart goes out to them. My heart is also with my son.” Chief Lawrence E. Revell of the Tallahassee Police Department said in a video statement that the suspect, a Florida State student, appeared to have no direct connection to his victims.

2025-04-18_82209,"Merger of Capital One and Discover, Two Credit Card Giants, Wins Approval","Two regulators signed off on the $35 billion deal, which the banks say will create a competitor to Visa and Mastercard. But consumer advocates warn that the deal may raise costs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/capital-one-discover-merger.html,2025-04-18 17:43:14,"Two regulators signed off on the $35 billion deal, which the banks say will create a competitor to Visa and Mastercard. But consumer advocates warn that the deal may raise costs. Two of the country’s largest credit card companies are poised to merge after key banking regulators approved the deal on Friday, despite concern among some advocacy groups and lawmakers that it could lead to higher fees and less choice for consumers. Capital One received the green light from the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to acquire Discover Financial Services in a roughly $35 billion deal announced in February 2024. Capital One, the nation’s ninth-largest bank, with $479 billion in assets, issues credit cards on networks run by Visa and Mastercard. Acquiring Discover will give it access to a credit card network of 305 million cardholders, adding to its base of more than 100 million customers. The banks, which said they expected the deal to close on May 18, have argued that the merger would create a stronger competitor to the giants in the network space: Visa and Mastercard. The deal will “increase competition in payment networks, offer a wider range of products to our customers, increase our resources devoted to innovation and security, and bring meaningful community benefits,” Michael Shepherd, the interim chief executive of Discover, said in a statement on Friday. But after the deal was announced, it was swiftly met with concerns from consumer advocates about concentration in the credit card market, since the country’s biggest credit card issuer would control its own network. “The feds got this one wrong — so it falls to state attorneys general to intervene against the harmful, anticompetitive Capital One-Discover merger,” Jesse Van Tol, the chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said in a statement. The group, which promotes access to banking services, has opposed the deal since it was announced. In announcing its approval, the Fed also said it had fined Discover $100 million for overcharging certain interchange fees — transaction fees that a merchant’s bank pays to the credit card-issuing bank — from 2007 to 2023. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in a statement on Friday, said its approval of the deal was conditional on the banks’ addressing “the root causes of any outstanding enforcement actions against Discover Bank and remediation of harm.” Capital One cleared another significant obstacle to its acquisition of Discover after the Justice Department, which also has authority to block banking deals, told regulators this month that it didn’t see sufficient competition concerns to block the merger. Banking analysts said the move indicated that Trump administration regulators might be more open than the Biden administration to bank mergers. During the Biden administration, the Justice Department told regulators that it was concerned, in part, about the deal’s impact on potential credit card users who had no credit. In the last months of the administration, the department moved to tighten oversight of banking deals, placing more stringent guidelines on how it evaluates banking deals — the first update to that framework since 2008. In February, shareholders of both companies approved the all-stock deal, which was valued at roughly $35 billion when it was announced last year.
