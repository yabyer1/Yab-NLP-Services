2025-04-19_762167,Trump Just Scrapped My Anti-Kremlin Streaming Platform,We called it Votvot — Russian for “any minute now.”,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/opinion/trump-defund-votvot-kremlin-russia.html,2025-04-19 11:00:18,"Guest Essay Mr. Idov co-founded Votvot, which was recently defunded by the American government. The Trump administration’s decision to take a hammer to the funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty might be legally dubious, but politically pretty safe: Its programming wasn’t intended to reach American audiences, so who would miss it, really? In September 2022, I came to Prague, in an unusual role of a volunteer media expert, to observe the operations of the Russian-language TV channel and online news portal, Current Time — one of the many brands under the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty umbrella. An American from Latvia whose native language is Russian, I had spent much of the previous decade trying to build bridges between the U.S. and Russian TV industries, a dream wiped out overnight with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Current Time had become an indispensable source of news for an audience misled by their own state media. Six months in, war coverage had pushed out almost all other reporting and fatigue was setting in. I wanted to be useful. If my knowledge of the Russian media could somehow help Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, I was happy to share it. Not to mention the fact that, as a lifelong fan of the band R.E.M., I’d never pass up a chance to visit the organization that helped inspire their debut single, “Radio Free Europe.” The organization’s headquarters was an imposing gray cube, just east of the city center. The general aura reminded me of a U.S. Embassy. It might be an editorially independent nongovernment entity, but its cultural and literal footprint was always that of an American values bulwark. I soon found I had landed in the middle of a philosophical debate. Would showing anything other than atrocities constitute catering to Russia? At the time of my arrival, the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty staff was considering starting a second channel that would run hard-hitting documentaries about Russian history and cruelties. I wondered who would be the audience for such depressing programming. A better tactic, I thought, would be to try to appeal to the persuadables, an audience many of whom had tuned out watching the news but retained a sense of right and wrong; an audience that Alexei Navalny, Russia’s opposition leader, had sacrificed his freedom — and, soon, his life — trying to reach. The walls of the headquarters were lined not only with photos of the likes of Henry Kissinger and Hillary Clinton, but also Duke Ellington and Tom Jones. Indeed, the older generation of Soviet citizens retained warm memories of the “enemy voices” (as Radio Liberty, Voice of America, and the BBC’s Russian Service were known) not because they delivered news from the West, but because they’d play jazz and rock ’n’ roll. Pop culture was the draw. I went back to the hotel and wrote out an email positing just that: What are the new areas of cultural scarcity? What have censorship and militarism taken away from the average young Russian? Some answers: uncensored stand-up comedy, freewheeling talk shows with no verboten topics and music by artists who hold opposition views. (Some, like my acquaintance, the rapper Ivan Dremin, a.k.a. FACE, were even declared “foreign agents.”) This initiative would also serve a secondary purpose. Since the start of the war, hundreds of thousands of Russia’s most promising and conscientious citizens had left the country, many forgoing their careers in the process. This new platform I imagined could provide a lifeline to the artists among them and a diversion for the rest. And it should be a streaming and video-on-demand platform, functioning as a site, a mobile app, and a production hub using the artists’ own YouTube channels for distribution. It turned out that someone at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty had been harboring a very similar vision. That someone was Stephen Capus, former president of NBC News and adviser to the United States Agency for Global Media, who had recently come onboard to consult for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Within weeks, we had written a proposal for this new media brand. It was approved almost instantly. It also created a fissure among the staff members, some of whom balked at “entertaining Russians.” My volunteer effort became a job. The platform began in April 2023. Its earliest offerings included a concert film by FACE (naturally), who alternated hedonistic raps with serious statements and at some point unfurled a Ukrainian flag; a stand-up set by Ariana Lolaeva, a rising comedian from North Ossetia who had a criminal case against her back in Russia; music by Boris Grebenshchikov, a rock ’n’ roll veteran with a Bob Dylan-like stature; and a Ukrainian documentary series about animals in war, anchored by Patron, the famous mine-sniffing dog. The last one, oddly enough, made the most important statement of all. It was one of the first instances of a Ukrainian collaboration with a Russophone media brand since the start of the war. Its very existence thus proclaimed two things: that a state was not its people, and that a Russian cultural platform could be unbound not only to Vladimir Putin but even to the Russian language. The name we picked for the service was Votvot. In Russian, the phrase “vot-vot” means both enthusiastic agreement, akin to “exactly” or the German “genau,” and something like “any minute now,” which some chose to read as a cheeky prediction of systemic change. The platform had an unofficial motto: “If the Kremlin hates it, we have it.” There is, certainly, room for discussion on whether financing foreign-facing media is a proper use of U.S. taxpayer money. In order to have this discussion in good faith, however, it’s necessary to establish what kind of money we’re talking about. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s entire annual operating budget in 2024 was $142 million, which covered a staff of more than 1,700 and services reaching 47 million weekly users in 27 languages. Votvot cost around $2 million a year, including all content and salaries. (For context, this is about 1/9000th of Netflix’s projected content budget this year). The Votvot team consisted of far-flung freelancers in places including Tbilisi, Georgia; Barcelona, Spain; Belgrade, Serbia; and Berlin. Several of them worked from Ukraine. We had more than a few editorial meetings from which someone had to excuse themselves early to head to a bomb shelter. One young woman was still in Moscow at the time of her hiring. I was gingerly explaining the risks of working with “foreign agents” over a Zoom when she lifted her hand into the frame to adjust her hair. Her fingernails were painted the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. Here, I knew, was someone utterly fearless. Within a few months, the job allowed her to leave Russia. On Feb. 20, 2024, the Russian authorities declared all of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty an “undesirable organization.” This designation was an escalation from “foreign agent” and just below “extremist organization.” (Instagram is also seen as extremist.) This meant that it was now illegal to share or comment on the content. Imagine trying to go viral when your viewers might be fined or jailed for pressing “like.” Worried about the safety of both our creators and our audience, we put up new content without advertising it.  As time went by and the war dragged on, the chasm between the Russians who stayed and the Russians who left kept growing. Many of those on the inside began to think of the ones on the outside as privileged and out of touch. A common critique of all media projects headquartered abroad is that this is just the diaspora talking to itself. Yet only those outside of Mr. Putin’s reach could sing, play or joke without being censored or censoring themselves. Votvot launched its first proper publicity campaign in September 2024. At that point, the content streaming on its platform included the Oscar-winning documentary “20 Days in Mariupol,” to which it held rights in 15 countries, and dozens of exclusive films, concerts and shows. Two months later, the United States restored Donald Trump to the presidency. Soon after his inauguration, Trump realigned America’s policies towards both Russia and Ukraine, and also decided the service is no longer worth paying for. It’s reasonable to infer that the real issue, in the administration’s eyes, is probably not the cost of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s programming, but what they called its far-left values (this, about an organization whose entire existence is based on fighting Communism). Starting on April 1, about half of its employees have been furloughed, freelancers dismissed and the Votvot experiment frozen. At the end, it had well over a million unique users. The satellite services that broadcast its programs to Russia were turned off on April 4. Mr. Capus, who had become the organization’s president in January 2024, is spearheading the effort to save its funding. But it’s not just the consumers of our content that have lost. Having worked for an “enemy,” many of the creators could face repercussions at home, and their ability to stay abroad is often dependent on their employment-based visa status. Some are probably safe in Spain and Germany; others are in Georgia and Serbia, countries that could very well be more susceptible to Russian influence. For a short while we were able to empower fearless creators to speak up against war and push back against censorship. Some may see this as government waste. I happen to see it as a smart investment in a generation that will one day run a post-Putin Russia — and is instead learning a lesson in American duplicity.

Reporting from Toronto When Canadians vote in parliamentary elections on April 28, they will essentially be choosing between two starkly different candidates to lead their country through a crisis brought on by President Trump’s tariffs and festering economic and social issues. Mark Carney, 60, the Liberal Party leader who has been serving as prime minister since early March, is a political novice. He has had a long career in central banking and global finance. Pierre Poilievre, 45, the Conservative Party leader, has been a politician for most of his adult life and is well known to voters, having meticulously curated his agenda, talking points and image. Two other candidates are vying to maintain their parties’ representation in Parliament: Jagmeet Singh of the New Democrats, a leftist party that has focused much of its campaign on health care, and Yves-François Blanchet of the Bloc Québécois, which runs candidates only in Quebec. But Mr. Poilievre and Mr. Carney are widely acknowledged to be the only two who can gain enough support to become prime minister. Mr. Carney is a former central banker who made his first foray into politics by winning the support of Liberal Party members to replace Justin Trudeau as the party’s leader last month.

Then Came ‘The Shrouds’,The acclaimed filmmaker discusses bringing death to the forefront in his latest picture.,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/movies/david-cronenberg-interview.html,2025-04-19 09:01:13,"What to Watch  The acclaimed filmmaker discusses bringing death to the forefront in his latest picture.  The acclaimed filmmaker discusses bringing death to the forefront in his latest picture. Credit... In 2017, during the funeral of his wife and longtime collaborator Carolyn Zeifman, the director David Cronenberg found himself struck by an unusual impulse: As the coffin holding her dead body was lowered into the ground, he wanted more than anything to get into that box with her. That reluctance to let go is taken to even more morbid extremes in Cronenberg’s new movie, “The Shrouds,” about a high-tech cemetery where the ongoing decomposition of a corpse can be viewed through a video livestream meant for the loved ones left behind. When those graves are mysteriously vandalized, it’s up to the cemetery owner Karsh (Vincent Cassel) to determine the culprits, who he suspects may have something to do with the death of his own wife (Diane Kruger). The 82-year-old Cronenberg has always been guided by a unique point of view as a filmmaker, and his classics like “Scanners,” “Videodrome” and “The Fly” helped establish the body-horror genre. Still, he admitted in an interview via Zoom this month that “The Shrouds” could be considered one of his most personal films: It’s not for nothing that Cassel is costumed to look like his director, donning dark suits and teasing his gray hair upward in a familiar manner. Even so, Cronenberg cautioned against drawing too many links between himself and his lead character. “As soon as you start to write a screenplay, you’re writing fiction, no matter what the impetus was in your own life,” Cronenberg said. “Suddenly, you’re creating characters that need to come to life. And when you start to write them, they start to push you around if they’re really alive.” Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

In the house group chat, usually a scroll of memes, reminders and dinner plans, one of Jack Kankiewicz’s roommates dropped a screenshot of an article about President Trump’s tariffs to global trading partners announced on April 2. Mr. Kankiewicz and his roommates debated the tariffs’ possible effects, and then returned to their usual discussions, with one roommate confirming that they would indeed be getting McDonald’s before seeing “A Minecraft Movie.” Previously, tariffs were something Mr. Kankiewicz might only expect to hear from his friends majoring in political science. But since Mr. Trump’s announcement, he said, it has entered his everyday lexicon. “My roommates and I have been tapping in a little more,” said Mr. Kankiewicz, 22. He realized he didn’t have a full understanding of tariffs, so he did some internet research to figure out how they might affect him, finding speculation on the rising prices of goods and a worsening job market.

They saw their families go through the 2008 financial crisis in elementary and middle school, then the Covid pandemic in high school and college.

Sandra and Tom Johnson were at home in Los Angeles County one January night, watching the news of the Palisades fire on television, when a neighbor knocked on the door. He wanted them to see it: flames in the mountains in nearby Eaton Canyon. Within the hour, firefighters ordered the Johnsons to leave their home in the community of Altadena. “We just had to forget our stuff, grab our dog and run,” said Ms. Johnson, 72, a retired mail truck driver for the Los Angeles Unified School District. The couple sped off while fire consumed their home of 49 years, as well as the yard studded with fruit trees and vegetable patches that Mr. Johnson, 76, had meticulously tended. They went to their daughter’s house in Palmdale, an hour north, and almost four months later, they’re still there. As they contemplate their next move, one thing feels clear: They are not going back and rebuilding. It’s a particularly fraught calculation for those 50 and older. “It’s too hard at this age to wait years and years and years to be back to normal,” Ms. Johnson said. Over the course of one short week, the Palisades fire, on the west side of Los Angeles County, and the Eaton fire, on the east side, destroyed more than 16,000 structures and damaged over 2,000 more, according to the state. Not counted in that tally are homes the blaze skirted, but are still uninhabitable because of smoke damage and a lack of utilities. That translates to tens of thousands of households trying rebuild or sell at a time when federal tariff and immigration policies could make constructing homes more complicated and expensive.

In the past few years, as labor costs have grown after two strikes, producers of reality shows, scrappy indie movies and blockbuster films have increasingly turned away from Los Angeles to filming locations overseas. Those business decisions have considerable consequences for the industry’s thousands of middle-class workers: the camera operators, set decorators and lighting technicians who make movies and television happen. Frustration has reached a boiling point, according to more than two dozen people who make their living in the entertainment industry. They say that nothing short of Hollywood, as we know it, is at stake. “This is an existential crisis — it’s an extinction event,” said Beau Flynn, a producer of big-budget movies like “San Andreas,” which despite being about an earthquake in California was filmed mostly in Australia. “These are real things. I am not a dramatist, even though I’m in the drama field.” Productions have been filmed outside the United States for decades, but rarely has Hollywood work been so bustling overseas at a time when work in Hollywood itself has been so scant. Studios in European countries are bursting at the seams, industry workers say. And film and television production in Los Angeles is down by more than one-third over the past 10 years, according to FilmLA data. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

2025-04-19_369291,Many Have Tried to Fix Penn Station. Can Trump Get the Job Done?,Transportation experts say a thorough renovation is likely to take several years to complete — unless emergency measures are employed.,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/nyregion/trump-penn-station.html,2025-04-19 07:00:27,"Transportation experts say a thorough renovation is likely to take several years to complete — unless emergency measures are employed. Political leaders in New York have been promising an overhaul of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan for so long that the saga has started to resemble the Arthurian legend of the sword in the stone. One by one, officials have tried to pull off ambitious renovation schemes, and one by one they have failed. On Thursday, President Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, joined the list. Asserting federal control of the station in a surprise announcement, he vowed to transform it into a safe, clean station that “reflects America’s greatness.” In all the years of political wrangling, consensus building and master planning, the many obstacles to a new Penn Station have never been challenged so directly by the power of a president. Nor has anyone tried the strong-arm tactics that have defined the first few months of Mr. Trump’s second term. Now, Mr. Trump’s methods — aggressive demands, bullying, bluster, disregard for legal and bureaucratic structures — will be put to the test against a problem that has for years been mired in a tangle of political cross-pressures and conflicting priorities. Transportation experts say that under normal circumstances, a thorough renovation of the nation’s busiest transit hub, which serves three different railroads, would most likely take several years and cost several billion dollars. This isn’t China, where a rail station can be upgraded seemingly overnight, they say. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

It was after 9 p.m. on a recent Wednesday inside the atrium of a sleek glass office building in Midtown Manhattan, and Jacky Yu let out a scream. She and six other people were playing One Night Ultimate Werewolf — a card game in which players have secret roles and use deduction skills to discover each other’s hidden identities — and there had just been a big reveal. “We got really excited,” Ms. Yu, 31, said. The room was buzzing. Hundreds of people had gathered for an evening of game playing. Every table was occupied by clusters of people leaning in, laughing and competing. New York can be expensive, overwhelming and intimidating, and sometimes it is hard for people to connect. A martini can cost $25 in a bar that’s too noisy for conversation, and raucous nightclubs aren’t for everyone. So a free, monthly B.Y.O.B. (bring your own board game) night in an office building food court has become a big hit. In addition to Werewolf, people were playing classics, like chess and mahjong, but also relatively newer games, including Catan, Splendor, Hues and Cues, Saboteur, Nertz, Wavelength, Blokus and Camel Up.

Patricia Mazzei reported from Miami; Andrew Pantazi from Tallahassee, Fla.; and Kate Selig and Christina Morales from New York. The 20-year-old student accused of killing two people and wounding six others at Florida State University had expressed extremist political views that made classmates uncomfortable, talked about his interest in guns and experienced years of family tumult that culminated in his changing his name in high school. The day after the shooting terrorized Florida State students, forcing them to flee or hide from gunfire at the university’s campus in Tallahassee, interviews and extensive court records offered an early portrait of the suspect, though law enforcement officials remained silent on what might have motivated the attack. “All I wanted for him was a loving environment,” his biological mother, Anne-Mari Eriksen, said on Friday in a brief interview, in which she was clearly upset. “I was always concerned about his mental health and happiness.” She said she remained bewildered by the shooting and had been against the presence of firearms in her son’s life. “I feel bad for the people at F.S.U.,” she said. “My heart goes out to them. My heart is also with my son.” Chief Lawrence E. Revell of the Tallahassee Police Department said in a video statement that the suspect, a Florida State student, appeared to have no direct connection to his victims.

2025-04-18_82209,"Merger of Capital One and Discover, Two Credit Card Giants, Wins Approval","Two regulators signed off on the $35 billion deal, which the banks say will create a competitor to Visa and Mastercard. But consumer advocates warn that the deal may raise costs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/capital-one-discover-merger.html,2025-04-18 17:43:14,"Two regulators signed off on the $35 billion deal, which the banks say will create a competitor to Visa and Mastercard. But consumer advocates warn that the deal may raise costs. Two of the country’s largest credit card companies are poised to merge after key banking regulators approved the deal on Friday, despite concern among some advocacy groups and lawmakers that it could lead to higher fees and less choice for consumers. Capital One received the green light from the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to acquire Discover Financial Services in a roughly $35 billion deal announced in February 2024. Capital One, the nation’s ninth-largest bank, with $479 billion in assets, issues credit cards on networks run by Visa and Mastercard. Acquiring Discover will give it access to a credit card network of 305 million cardholders, adding to its base of more than 100 million customers. The banks, which said they expected the deal to close on May 18, have argued that the merger would create a stronger competitor to the giants in the network space: Visa and Mastercard. The deal will “increase competition in payment networks, offer a wider range of products to our customers, increase our resources devoted to innovation and security, and bring meaningful community benefits,” Michael Shepherd, the interim chief executive of Discover, said in a statement on Friday. But after the deal was announced, it was swiftly met with concerns from consumer advocates about concentration in the credit card market, since the country’s biggest credit card issuer would control its own network. “The feds got this one wrong — so it falls to state attorneys general to intervene against the harmful, anticompetitive Capital One-Discover merger,” Jesse Van Tol, the chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said in a statement. The group, which promotes access to banking services, has opposed the deal since it was announced. In announcing its approval, the Fed also said it had fined Discover $100 million for overcharging certain interchange fees — transaction fees that a merchant’s bank pays to the credit card-issuing bank — from 2007 to 2023. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in a statement on Friday, said its approval of the deal was conditional on the banks’ addressing “the root causes of any outstanding enforcement actions against Discover Bank and remediation of harm.” Capital One cleared another significant obstacle to its acquisition of Discover after the Justice Department, which also has authority to block banking deals, told regulators this month that it didn’t see sufficient competition concerns to block the merger. Banking analysts said the move indicated that Trump administration regulators might be more open than the Biden administration to bank mergers. During the Biden administration, the Justice Department told regulators that it was concerned, in part, about the deal’s impact on potential credit card users who had no credit. In the last months of the administration, the department moved to tighten oversight of banking deals, placing more stringent guidelines on how it evaluates banking deals — the first update to that framework since 2008. In February, shareholders of both companies approved the all-stock deal, which was valued at roughly $35 billion when it was announced last year.

YF_359911,Mach Natural Resources LP (MNR): Among the Dividend Paying Stocks Insiders Are Buying,no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mach-natural-resources-lp-mnr-150454435.html,2025-04-22 15:04:54,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Paying Stocks Insiders Are Buying. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mach Natural Resources LP (NYSE:MNR) stands against the other dividend paying stocks. Uncertainty is not among the market's favorites. Yet, at present, uncertainty is prevailing throughout the market. The U.S.-China trade escalation and the new tariffs on all other U.S. trading partners have left investors scrambling to find stable ground. READ ALSO: 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Just this week, CNBC reported President Trump's announcement to charge steep fees on ships built in China, presently docking at the U.S. ports, a move the analysts perceive could cause the shipping costs to go high and send a ripple through consumer prices. China, the significant retaliator to Trump's tariffs, has started targeting the U.S. service sector by threatening everything from tourism to tech talent pipelines. Even the blue-chip stocks find the current climate unfavorable, thus increasing the adoption rate of another strategy: dividend-paying stocks. And here's the kicker – insiders are loading up on them. Dividends are the financial shock absorbers when growth stocks swing wildly on trade war headlines. Investors in such an unfavorable market condition often prioritize the cash flow today rather than the promises of growth tomorrow. Historically, in many instances, when the market is experiencing turbulence, the dividend-paying stocks outperformed their non-dividend peers. In addition to padding the portfolio, the dividend stocks have signaled corporate resilience. And right now, insiders like executives and board members are betting big on the stability of the dividend stocks. Corporate leaders buy shares of their companies to add credibility to the stocks. At the same time, it also indicates that they see an undervalued potential in their stocks. Unlike analysts, the insiders have first-hand information regarding earnings forecasts, balance sheets, and the company's strategies that would allow it to weather the upcoming storms. The recent U.S.-China tariff escalations stand as a prime example of such storms. The headlines focus on the two countries' shipping fees and rare-earth export controls. Meanwhile, board members of some companies are scooping up stocks. But these are not speculative plays; they are calculated decisions made using the unique knowledge of the company's cash flows, debt, and history of raising dividends. Now, let us zoom out. The market position is clear. According to CNBC, volatility has become the new normal with China's retaliation squeezing the services trade sector, where the U.S. holds a $32 billion surplus. Finding an appropriate dividend that could add some resilience to the portfolio becomes a necessity. Using insider backing to find the best stock offers a rare blend of defensive positioning and growth potential. In this regard, we have done the legwork to uncover 10 dividend-paying stocks with high insider confidence. In addition to offering a positive yield, our picks could fortify your investments against the market chaos caused by the trade war. You may be hedging against inflation, chasing reliable income, or simply copying the moves of those in the know. When putting together our top 10 picks for the best dividend-paying stocks investors are buying, we followed a few criteria. We set the dividend yield at a minimum of 3%. This criterion is in place to provide investors with optimal income-generating stocks. We did not include stocks with an insider ownership change of less than 4% in the last six months since a larger percentage correlates with a significant shift in ownership, potentially based on recent and relevant information. Stocks with an average volume of over 200,000 are included in the list, suggesting much trading activity with strong interest from buyers and sellers. Additionally, we have considered only those stocks with a positive return on equity (ROE). With this criterion, we ensured that our picks generated income for the investments made by the shareholders. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 16, 2025. And we have ranked our picks based on the percentage change in insider ownership. A large natural gas pipeline snaking through a rural landscape.

YF_476887,Over 50% of US Workers Don’t Negotiate Their Starting Salaries — How To Improve Your Offer,no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/over-50-us-workers-don-150509485.html,2025-04-22 15:05:09,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. Not negotiating your starting salary at a new job could cause you to miss out on thousands of dollars a year — if not more. Add that amount up over the course of multiple years or decades and you could be losing out on a substantial amount of cash. Discover More: Here’s How To Use AI To Quickly Start a Side Gig, According to Codie Sanchez Find Out: 12 SUVs With the Most Reliable Engines More than half (55%) of people don’t negotiate their first salary, according to Resume Genius’ 2025 Salary Negotiation and Expectations Survey of 1,000 full-time U.S. workers. Here are the other key findings of the survey, as well as some well-known strategies for negotiating salaries during the hiring process. Even though more people are starting to negotiate salaries during the hiring process, it’s still not as common as you might think. Roughly 45% of survey respondents negotiate their starting salary, while 55% people simply accept what they’re offered. Other key findings include: Seventy-eight percent of those who negotiate receive a better offer. Fifty-one percent get an offer matching what they ask for. Just 22% of those who negotiate don’t receive a better offer. The survey also found that men (51%) are more likely to negotiate than women (39%). Interestingly, when women do negotiate, they often end up getting better results: A whopping 82% of women who negotiate get a better offer, compared to 76% of men. Fifty-four percent of women who negotiate receive a matching offer, compared to 50% of men. Age appears to play a role in people’s willingness to negotiate their starting salary, as well: Fifty-five percent of Gen Z negotiate. Forty-eight percent of millennials negotiate. Forty-two percent of Gen X and baby boomers negotiate. Again, the majority of people who negotiate get a higher starting salary. Read Next: I Made $10,000 Using One of Dave Ramsey’s Best Passive Income Ideas Perhaps unsurprisingly, most people (57%) regret either not negotiating or asking for more during the process. Nearly a third (30%) say they wish they’d negotiated more, but still felt it was the best decision at the time. About a quarter (27%) of those who didn’t negotiate at all regret not doing so. If you feel like you deserve a certain starting salary but aren’t sure how to go about it, here are some top strategies to consider: Know What You’re Worth. Before going to a job interview or applying for a job with a low salary, make a list of the experience and skills you can talk about. Look into typical salaries in your area based on experience. Compare Salaries. Use a site like Glassdoor or Payscale to find what companies in your industry and area are offering. Know Your Rights. Pay transparency laws exist to help you get a fair offer. Check with the U.S. Department of Labor or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to see the state or regional laws. Use Tact When Discussing Salary. If the interviewer asks what you expect, tell them you’re willing to negotiate or are comfortable with the listed salary range. If they don’t have a range, ask about their budget. Be Prepared To Demonstrate Your Worth. This means preparing before the interview. Conduct mock interviews with a friend about how your experiences align with the job — and make you the best candidate (and worth a higher salary). Come With Your Own Salary Range. Sometimes, you might have to come to the table with your acceptable minimum salary. Give a range of the salary you’d accept based on your experience and what other companies are offering. Don’t Overshare. Keep your previous or current salary to yourself. Otherwise, a potential employer might use that to give you a lowball offer. Be Open To Negotiate. If you receive a low offer but still want to proceed with the opportunity, see if you can bridge the gap. If the company can’t increase the base pay, consider other compensation — like stock options or retirement contributions. These can add up, too.

Gratitude is no longer important in the tech world. Although users may be using these words to remain on AI’s good side in the event it takes over, it is costing companies millions of dollars. In the latest news, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has revealed how showing good manners to a ChatGPT model, such as saying “please” and “thank you,” adds up to millions of dollars in operational expenses. When asked how much the company has lost in electricity costs from people being polite, this is what Altman had to say: “Tens of millions of dollars well spent — you never know.” While that may be so, Kurt Beavers, a director on the design team for Microsoft Copilot, noted how “using polite language sets a tone for the response,” and that when an AI model “clocks politeness, it’s more likely to be polite back.” READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week and 10 AI Stocks You Shouldn’t Overlook Right Now. Even though politeness may come at a cost for the ChatGPT maker, these may be trivial when it comes to the immense scale at which the company operates itself. The company has recently released its latest artificial intelligence model, claiming that it can “ think with images”. The main new reasoning model from OpenAI is known as the o3, while the smaller model released simultaneously is known as the o4-mini. The o3 allows users to upload whiteboards, sketches, and other images that AI can analyze and discuss. The company is fiercely competing to stay ahead in the artificial intelligence race, facing intense competition from companies such as Google and Anthropic. “For the first time, our reasoning models can independently use all ChatGPT tools — web browsing, Python, image understanding, and image generation. This helps them solve complex, multi-step problems more effectively and take real steps toward acting independently.” O3 and o4-mini are OpenAI’s first AI models that have the ability to “think with images.” This implies that “they don’t just see an image, they can integrate visual information directly into the reasoning chain,” OpenAI noted.

YF_540438,Is NVIDIA (NVDA) the Most Promising Long-Term Stock According to Analysts?,no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-most-promising-long-145923660.html,2025-04-22 14:59:23,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently published a list of the 11 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other promising long-term stocks. On March 31, Banrion’s Shana Sissel recently appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to discuss that buying at lower valuations is favorable for long-term investors. Shana Sissel highlighted that the markets now want transparency, given the persistent volatility that has lasted for a while now. When this clarity is lacking, it becomes difficult for investors and businesses to plan for the long term. This uncertainty has led to soft consumer and CEO confidence, which makes it challenging to develop long-term strategies when key aspects such as industrial policy, business policy, and taxes remain unresolved in the US. Sissel emphasized that until there is more certainty, volatility is likely to persist. She expressed skepticism that any immediate announcements would provide the level of information investors desire, especially because of the administration’s habit of making statements that are later contradicted or revised. However, Sissel pointed out that long-term investors can find attractive buying opportunities if they look beyond the current uncertainty. She noted that the recent drop in valuations for many tech stocks now presents favorable buying opportunities for long-term investors. Regardless of the short-term fluctuations in policy uncertainty, many tech and security companies still benefit from long-term demand due to trends like the ongoing adoption of AI and the growing need for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection. Even when government decisions are unclear, these sectors are resilient because their products and services address fundamental needs that are unlikely to change with fluctuating market cycles. We first sifted through the Finviz stock screener and financial media reports to compile a list of the top stocks with high upside potential of over 40%. We then selected 11 stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 20%. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024, which was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Note: All data was sourced on April 21. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 39.48% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 Average Upside Potential as of April 21: 65.53% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company that offers graphics and compute & networking solutions internationally. It sells its products to original equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators and distributors, independent software vendors, cloud service providers, consumer internet companies, and others. The growing adoption of NVIDIA’s Blackwell architecture is driving its revenue. In FQ4 2025, Blackwell’s revenue totaled $11 billion, which marked the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. Blackwell delivers ~25 times higher token throughput and 20 times lower cost than the Hopper 100 for reasoning AI. Large cloud service providers like Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI are deploying Blackwell systems to meet their growing demand for AI infrastructure. The overall Data Center segment at NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) made a record $35.6 billion in revenue in FQ4, which was a 93% year-over-year improvement. For the entire fiscal year 2025, the revenue doubled. However, Argus lowered the stock’s price target to $150 from $175 while keeping a Buy rating on April 17. The firm believes that the fresh US licensing requirements for AI chip exports, which include NVIDIA’s H20 models, will potentially impact quarterly earnings by as much as $55 billion. Guinness Global Innovators is highly bullish on NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to its dominant AI chip market position. It stated the following in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “For a second year running, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund’s top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia’s ‘Hopper’ GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‘Hopper’ GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia’s extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to “inference” (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia’s financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia’s data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia’s technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia’s valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.” Overall, NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the 11 most promising long-term stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

YF_268751,"Gold's record run gains further traction; market conquers $3,500/oz",no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/golds-record-run-gains-further-150546510.html,2025-04-22 15:05:46,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. By Ashitha Shivaprasad and Anjana Anil (Reuters) -Gold's remarkable run higher is reaching new heights, with the market touching $3,500 per ounce as confidence in the U.S. economy further erodes after President Donald Trump's renewed attack on the Federal Reserve chair. Spot gold was trading around $3,428 per ounce by 1417 GMT, after hitting a record $3,500.05 earlier in the session. Trump said on Monday the U.S. economy could slow down unless interest rates are lowered immediately, repeating his criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell as being slow to act and calling him a ""major loser"". That was followed by a furious flight from U.S. assets which undermined Wall Street and the dollar, while concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve piled fresh pressure on Treasuries. [USD/] [MKTS/GLOB] ""Gold is recalibrating to reflect what can only be described as epic changes in the global financial system. And those changes are a widespread and fundamental shift in confidence in the world’s reserve currency and its bond markets,"" said independent analyst Ross Norman. Bullion, renowned as a hedge against uncertainties and a highly liquid asset, has surged more than $800 since the start of the year. It surpassed $3,300 last Wednesday, and its strong momentum pushed it up by nearly $200 in just a few days. CENTRAL BANK DEMAND Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, said central bank demand ""is very likely chasing gold's move higher, because Trump 2.0’s chaos only hardens gold’s appeal as a geopolitical asset"". In the final quarter of 2024, when Trump won the U.S. election, central bank purchases accelerated 54% year-on-year to 333 tons, according to an estimate from the World Gold Council. Data showed that China's central bank added gold to its reserves in March for the fifth straight month. China is considering setting up overseas warehouses to aid international settlement of specific products on the Shanghai Gold Exchange, its central bank said. CORRECTION - LIKELY TO BE SHORT-LIVED Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs increased its year-end gold forecast to $3,700. It added that if central bank buying averages 100 tonnes/month, it estimates gold could reach $3,810 by end-2025. ANZ last week also raised its year-end gold price forecast to $3,600. Asked about a pause in the rally, analysts and experts said any correction is likely to be short-lived, and greater gains are most likely on the horizon if instability persists. ""It is hard just now to see a scenario where gold could correct sharply lower as a physical floor of Johnny-come-lately buyers would support or cushion the decline,"" said Norman. Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said a major road block for gold ""would be a less confrontative President Trump, either on the side of trade or on the side of monetary policy - both of which seem rather unlikely at the moment"". Spot gold has hit 28 record highs so far in 2025, of which 16 are above the $3,000/oz milestone. Prices are up 31% so far this year, after ending 2024 with a 27% annual rise.

YF_75799,"IBM Earnings On Deck. AI Push, 'Safe-Haven' Status, DOGE Cuts In Focus.",no summary,https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-stock-q1-2025-earnings-tariffs-ai-doge/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo,2025-04-22 14:48:05,"BREAKING: Futures Mixed After Stocks Extend Gains IBM (IBM) will report first-quarter earnings late Wednesday. Despite the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average slumping this year, IBM stock has held on to its gains — a trend some on Wall Street expect to continue. IBM stock has gained 7% year-to-date, outperforming a 10% loss from the S&P 500. Shares of the more than century-old tech company rallied 35% last year, helped by Wall Street's increasing confidence the tech giant can benefit from AI demand. Shares returned to record highs for the first time in a decade. On the stock market today, IBM stock is up more than 2% at 241.30. IBM hasn't been completely spared from concerns about the broader economy, however. Shares are down 11% from a high of 265.72 reached in early February. IBM stock took a hit last month after technology consulting rival Accenture (ACN) warned U.S. government business could see slower growth, citing broad federal spending cuts promised by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's DOGE initiative. But some analysts have noted that IBM historically holds up when markets get choppy. ""IBM remains attractive and has historically outperformed peers in 2000, 2008 and 2020,"" BofA Securities Wamsi Mohan said in a client note earlier this month. ""Additionally, only 10% of their COGS (cost of goods sold) spend is hardware and most of their manufacturing is U.S. based."" Mohan holds a buy rating for IBM stock. Here's what to watch ahead of IBM's first quarter report: Overall, analysts polled by FactSet expect IBM to post adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share, down 15% from a year earlier. Analysts project revenue will decrease by fraction year-over-year, to $14.4 billion for the quarter. IBM's software division is project to have the strongest quarter, with 7.5% year-over-year revenue growth. But that could be weighed down by the 10.2% decrease in infrastructure related sales for revenue that analysts are projecting, according to FactSet. Consulting revenue is also projected to decrease, by 2.6%. IBM's software division is its largest revenue source, with analysts projecting software sales will account for 44% of IBM's first quarter revenue. Consulting is seen accounting for 35% of sales and infrastructure 19%. Ahead of its report, IBM has a buy rating from 12 of the 22 analysts following the stock, according to FactSet. It has neutral calls from six analysts and sell warnings from four analysts. The average target price of 255.50 among all analysts implies about 8% upside from IBM stock's closing price Monday. Evercore ISI's Amit Daryanani is among the analysts who are bullish on IBM. He told clients on Monday that he expects IBM to perform in-line with consensus estimates for the first quarter, helped by strong software performance. ""We think IBM should fare better vs. peers given their mostly (Fortune 500) customer base and high mix of recurring software/consulting revenue, while we think potential tariff impact within infrastructure should be manageable,"" Daryanani wrote. However, he added, ""one area of potential softness could be IBM's Consulting segment given federal government spend efficiency efforts (U.S. federal government is roughly 5% of total revenue)."" But ""AI tailwinds"" for IBM's software business could help offset those concerns, Daryanani wrote. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring on Tuesday reiterated a neutral equal-weight call and price target of 237 for IBM stock. ""Amidst a challenging fundamental backdrop, IBM likely maintains safe-haven status with a largely in-line Q1/Q2 and no change to full year guidance,"" Woodring wrote. Earlier this month, Woodring and Morgan Stanley's IT sector analysts lowered their price targets for 15 of the 16 stocks they cover in response to President Donald Trump tariffs. IBM was the exception, with the analysts actually increasing their IBM price target to 237 from 228. The analysts expect IBM can ""weather today's volatility,"" Woodring wrote on April 8, but still see ""limited valuation or estimate upside, which keeps us equal-weight rated."" Meanwhile, IBM stock has a ""Blue Dot"" on its Relative Strength line, according to MarketSurge charts from Investor's Business Daily. Relative Strength measures a stock performance compared with the rest of the market. The RS Line Blue Dot shows strong outperformance vs. the benchmark S&P 500 index. IBM stock's Relative Strength Rating checks in at 91 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. That indicates IBM stock has outperformed 91% of stocks tracked by IBD over the past 12 months. Further, IBM stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 82 out a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bank of America shareholders voted on Tuesday to approve pay packages for CEO Brian Moynihan and the lender's top executives, and also elected its 14 directors on the board. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended that investors vote against the payouts, expressing concerns about the process used to set the compensation. Moynihan earned $35 million for last year, an increase of roughly 21%. The company's board credited him with growing its net income 2.3% last year and boosting revenue 3.4%. On U.S. plans to impose tariffs on trading partners, Moynihan said any impact on the bank will be indirect - on how a trade war affects the economy. ""The impact on our bank will be through the economic impact of a trade war... so if you believe that consumption falls and that results in reductions in force of employees and unemployment rate would go up,"" he said. The administration of President Donald Trump earlier this month announced, then paused, sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, throwing the global economy into a state of uncertainty. Moynihan reiterated that the bank's economic team does not see a recession this year, but expects the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates because inflation is sticky. Regarding a question about the risk of Trump sacking Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the CEO said an independent central bank is one of the important things about U.S. consistency. Trump stepped up his criticism of Fed Chair Powell for not cutting interest rates, calling him a ""major loser"", in a social media post on Monday, which raised concerns about the president's influence over the central bank. BofA's shareholders also voted on other management proposals, but rejected all individual shareholder proposals. These individual proposals included a request to the board to annually report on the alignment of its lobbying and policy influence activities with regard to its 2030 sectoral emissions reduction and 2050 net zero targets. BofA had joined other major U.S. banks to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, one of the world's top banking sector climate coalitions in recent months. BofA topped estimates for first-quarter profit as interest income grew and volatile markets helped its stock traders rake in a record haul.

Even the blue-chip stocks find the current climate unfavorable, thus increasing the adoption rate of another strategy: dividend-paying stocks. And here's the kicker – insiders are loading up on them. Dividends are the financial shock absorbers when growth stocks swing wildly on trade war headlines. Investors in such an unfavorable market condition often prioritize the cash flow today rather than the promises of growth tomorrow. Historically, in many instances, when the market is experiencing turbulence, the dividend-paying stocks outperformed their non-dividend peers. In addition to padding the portfolio, the dividend stocks have signaled corporate resilience. And right now, insiders like executives and board members are betting big on the stability of the dividend stocks. Corporate leaders buy shares of their companies to add credibility to the stocks. At the same time, it also indicates that they see an undervalued potential in their stocks. Unlike analysts, the insiders have first-hand information regarding earnings forecasts, balance sheets, and the company's strategies that would allow it to weather the upcoming storms. The recent U.S.-China tariff escalations stand as a prime example of such storms. The headlines focus on the two countries' shipping fees and rare-earth export controls. Meanwhile, board members of some companies are scooping up stocks. But these are not speculative plays; they are calculated decisions made using the unique knowledge of the company's cash flows, debt, and history of raising dividends. Now, let us zoom out. The market position is clear. According to CNBC, volatility has become the new normal with China's retaliation squeezing the services trade sector, where the U.S. holds a $32 billion surplus. Finding an appropriate dividend that could add some resilience to the portfolio becomes a necessity. Using insider backing to find the best stock offers a rare blend of defensive positioning and growth potential. In this regard, we have done the legwork to uncover 10 dividend-paying stocks with high insider confidence. In addition to offering a positive yield, our picks could fortify your investments against the market chaos caused by the trade war. You may be hedging against inflation, chasing reliable income, or simply copying the moves of those in the know. When putting together our top 10 picks for the best dividend-paying stocks investors are buying, we followed a few criteria. We set the dividend yield at a minimum of 3%. This criterion is in place to provide investors with optimal income-generating stocks. We did not include stocks with an insider ownership change of less than 4% in the last six months since a larger percentage correlates with a significant shift in ownership, potentially based on recent and relevant information. Stocks with an average volume of over 200,000 are included in the list, suggesting much trading activity with strong interest from buyers and sellers. Additionally, we have considered only those stocks with a positive return on equity (ROE). With this criterion, we ensured that our picks generated income for the investments made by the shareholders. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 16, 2025. And we have ranked our picks based on the percentage change in insider ownership. A technician filling bottles with nature-based ingredients for the company's personal care products. Change in Insider Ownership: 6.41% Dividend Yield: 3.37% A specialty materials company, Ashland Inc. (NYSE:ASH) serves markets such as pharmaceuticals, personal care, coatings, and adhesives from its headquarters located in Delaware. The company's portfolio includes excipients, rheology modifiers, and biofunctional ingredients. Customization of these products is carried out about performance and regulatory compliance. Formulation expertise and innovation focusing on sustainability allow the company to compete against market players like DuPont. The company repositioned itself toward high-margin and science-based businesses, increasing its foothold despite consumer demand shifts. Ashland Inc. (NYSE:ASH)'s sales in the first quarter of 2025 went down by 14%, reaching $405 million due to portfolio optimization, including the divestiture of Nutraceutical. On the other hand, the strong demand for skin and hair care resulted in a fourth consecutive quarter of over 25% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the personal care segment. Additionally, the portfolio optimization initiatives, though they have caused a decline in sales in the recent quarter, are expected by the company to improve profitability in the long term. As per the 2025 company guidance, a sale of $1.90 billion to $2.05 billion is anticipated. Ashland Inc. (NYSE:ASH) has high internal optimism, as insider ownership has surged by 6.41% in the last six months. Though it has the lowest dividend yield (3.37%) on our list, the company could be the best addition for investors looking to diversify their portfolio with a dividend-paying stock from the chemicals and specialty ingredients industry. Overall ASH ranks 3rd on our list of the dividend paying stocks insiders are buying. While we acknowledge the potential of ASH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ASH but trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

YF_605554,Is Cisco Systems (CSCO) a Cheap NASDAQ Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?,no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-csco-cheap-nasdaq-145736972.html,2025-04-22 14:57:36,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently published a list of the 11 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other cheap NASDAQ stocks. On April 10, Dan Ives, Head of Global Tech Research at Wedbush Securities, appeared on an interview at CNBC and expressed that the tech sector could be heading into a period of major volatility. Dan Ives addressed the current landscape for technology companies and pointed out that while a temporary pause in tariffs has provided some structure, the sector remains uncertain in general. He noted that even with this framework, large tech purchases are still being downsized or paused, which contributes to ongoing volatility, especially as companies approach earnings season. Many tech firms are either withholding guidance or providing only general outlooks. Ives described the situation as a storm whose full damage is only beginning to be assessed, with the industry still only a quarter of the way through the fallout. He explained the sharp pullback in major tech stocks by likening it to emerging from a storm and confronting the resulting damage. Ives highlighted that the uncertainty in tech has been amplified by the escalating tariffs on China, which are now as high as 125%, and are a major concern for a lot of companies, as China remains central to the global tech supply chain. Ives also pointed out that the recent tariffs on China have forced companies to reconsider the costs and logistics of importing critical components. For example, a $100,000 part might now cost double due to tariffs, causing companies to halt or delay large investments. This has resulted in a notable pause in tech spending, which he expects to continue at least through the current quarter. He cautioned that the June quarter is likely to be very weak. He maintained that, despite the challenges, he has not downgraded tech stocks, drawing on lessons from the pandemic playbook, where periods of uncertainty eventually led to clear winners and losers. Ives also addressed concerns that tech companies, by pulling back on spending, might risk drawing negative attention from the administration, especially given recent meetings between tech CEOs and the president. He reiterated that China is the epicenter of the current turmoil and that big tech is caught in the middle of a high-stakes situation, with companies still trying to navigate the evolving landscape. Ives predicted that Street estimates are likely to see earnings cuts of about 10% across internet and big tech companies, which reflects the broader pullback in spending and ongoing volatility.

We recently published a list of 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stands against other cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The broad-based market anxiety increased as the US policy uncertainty rose, says Fidelity. The financial markets were weighed down by tariff hikes, deregulation, and tighter immigration policies. The global business cycle is now less synchronized. As per the investment management firm, the US seemed to show mid- and late-cycle dynamics in Q1 2025. Furthermore, the diversification across fixed income and non-US assets is of utmost importance amid growth risks. While the gold and commodities gained, the US dollar decline fueled the non-US equities, says Fidelity. As per Fidelity, the uncertainty regarding the direction of US policy impacted the financial markets during Q1, with investors digesting the news related to executive actions, such as tariff increases, deregulation announcements, reduced government staffing and programs, and tougher immigration activities. Also, the worries related to the economic effects of the tariff increases on the global economy saw an increase during the days after the quarter closed. Despite elevated growth risks, the global expansion was intact as of the close of Q1. Fidelity opines that diversification in fixed income assets and non-US assets is essential. As per the investment manager, the S&P 500 Index delivered a return of −4.3% for Q1 2025, partly because of the performance of growth stocks (−10%). On the other hand, gold (+19%) and commodities (+8.9%) saw robust gains amid higher market uncertainty. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. According to Fidelity, the consumer inflation remained rangebound at ~3% during Q1, which was well above the 2% target of the US Fed. The firm anticipates sticky inflation around 3% for the next year, with upside risk resulting from tariff increases. As per the firm, the consumer inflation expectations have increased to multi-decade highs, making it simpler for businesses to pass the increased costs. Coming to the labor, it has remained tight so far, despite increased policy uncertainty, government layoffs, and federal funding cuts, says Fidelity. On the supply side, the broader labor force participation has stalled below the pre-pandemic rate due to slowing immigration as well as demographic constraints. As per Marci McGregor, Head of Portfolio Strategy (Chief Investment Office), Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, the next few months can be a good time to play defense. The investors can consider defensive, dividend-paying, and value-oriented stocks. For the long term, the investors can position themselves for when the uncertainty around trade decreases. The volatility can provide a chance to buy assets supporting the long-term strategy at attractive prices, says McGregor. To list the 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we scanned the holdings of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and chose companies that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x.

YF_996184,U.S. Bank shares tribute on earnings call to executive Terry Dolan who died in Minnesota plane crash,no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bank-shares-tribute-earnings-150252387.html,2025-04-22 15:02:52,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. U.S. Bancorp honored longtime executive Terry Dolan during its first earnings call of the year, following his death in a plane crash on March 31, where he was the sole passenger. Remembered for his leadership, warmth, and community contributions, Dolan was celebrated by colleagues and investors for his pivotal role in the bank's growth and his deep commitment to philanthropy. On its first earnings call of the year U.S. Bancorp executives remembered their former colleague Terry Dolan, who died in a plane crash in Minnesota last month. Previously the bank said it believed Dolan had died when the Socata TBM 700 airplane registered in his name crashed into a home near Brooklyn Park on the outskirts of Minneapolis on March 31. On April 1 authorities confirmed Dolan, 63, had been the pilot and sole passenger on board the flight. ""As we collectively mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Terry Dolan, the U.S. Bank family truly appreciates the outpouring of support and heartfelt condolences we’ve received from far and wide. Our prayers continue to be with his family and friends during this most difficult time,"" CEO Gunjan Kedia said in a press release ahead of the earnings call. On the call investors and analysts shared their condolences with the team at U.S. Bank, remembering Dolan's ""big smile and warm embrace."" ""He’ll be missed by everybody on this call and throughout the investment community,"" added Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Kedia, who had taken over the top job at U.S. Bank days before the earnings update, opened her remarks with thanks to those peers, adding: ""We have truly appreciated the outpouring of support we have received from the investment community since his tragic passing last month and our thoughts remain with his friends and family."" Per a statement from the FAA, Dolan's plane departed from Des Moines International Airport in Iowa and was bound for Anoka County-Blaine Airport in Minneapolis. The accident occurred at approximately 12.20pm. One person was in the home that the plane crashed into, but the individual was able to escape safely. Dolan was born and bred in Minnesota, where U.S. Bank is based, and was the tenth of 13 children in a busy farming family. Per his obituary in 'The Minnesota Star', Dolan was a keen sportsman who met his wife, Susan Mix, at a golf club, and the pair married in 1982. A year later, Dolan graduated from Minnesota's University of St Thomas with a degree in accounting. He began his career in public accounting before specializing in banking. The Dolan family moved to Ohio but returned to their home state in 1998 courtesy of an offer to join U.S. Bank. At America's fifth-largest bank, Dolan served in a range of roles, including vice chair of wealth management and investment services, executive vice president and controller, chief financial officer and ultimately vice chair and chief administration officer. Dolan is credited with helping lead the bank on its journey of growth and digital transformation, while maintaining its well-reported focus on strong risk management and finances. The executive also let the bank's community development work, including investments in areas such as affordable housing and renewable energy tax credit financing. Dolan's fellow alumni at the University of St Thomas include U.S. Bank's former CEO Andy Cecere, who wrote in a communication to employees before his departure: “Terry was an outstanding businessman, but more importantly, he was a wonderful person. He cared deeply about the people he worked with and the teams he led, and his legacy can be seen everywhere we look. ""I have been reflecting on Terry’s life and the friendship we shared in the few quiet moments we’ve had since this news first reached us. I have known him since college, and it has been a privilege working with him here for more than 25 years.” Dolan was also remembered for his philanthropy. At St Thomas, for example, he established the Dolan Family Endowed Scholarship fund in 2012 to support undergraduate students with academic merit in support of financial need. He also served on the boards of a number of charities and cultural organizations such as the Minnesota Opera.

YF_342811,Why Standard Lithium Stock Soared Today,no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-standard-lithium-stock-soared-150257503.html,2025-04-22 15:02:57,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. Lithium mining start-up Standard Lithium (NYSEMKT: SLI), which (six months after I last wrote about it) still isn't actually producing any lithium at all, is nonetheless enjoying a banner day on the stock market Tuesday, its shares up 7.8% through 10:10 a.m. ET. And why? Standard Lithium could soon turn into a real lithium company. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » In an 8-K filing with the SEC this morning (containing a press release apparently issued yesterday), Standard Lithium announced that the South West Arkansas project (SWA) of its Smackover Lithium joint venture with Norwegian energy concern Equinor ASA has been designated a ""priority transparency critical mineral project"" under President Trump's Executive Order 14241 on ""Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production."" That's quite a mouthful. Here's what it means, though, according to Standard Lithium: ""Support from the White House signals strong federal backing for the project, reinforcing its role in reducing U.S. reliance on China."" It also makes SWA one of only three domestic lithium projects in the U.S. receiving Department of Energy support. It remains to be seen if this support will be of the financial or merely moral variety, however, and for the time being investors should probably presume the latter. That probably means investors should anticipate significant capital expenditures on Standard Lithium's part as the company continues to develop itself from its start-up phase and move toward actual lithium-producing operations. How long will that take, though? No one seems to know. None of the analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence are willing to even hazard a guess as to when Standard Lithium will begin producing revenue, much less profit -- other than to say that neither revenue nor profit can be expected before 2027. Long story short, today's news is a positive development for Standard Lithium, but not one to bet the ranch on. This start-up remains a speculative stock and should be treated as such. Before you buy stock in Standard Lithium, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Standard Lithium wasn’t one of them.

YF_989055,Is American Express Company (AXP) the Cheap Blue Chip Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?,no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-company-axp-cheap-145422757.html,2025-04-22 14:54:22,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently published a list of 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stands against other cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The broad-based market anxiety increased as the US policy uncertainty rose, says Fidelity. The financial markets were weighed down by tariff hikes, deregulation, and tighter immigration policies. The global business cycle is now less synchronized. As per the investment management firm, the US seemed to show mid- and late-cycle dynamics in Q1 2025. Furthermore, the diversification across fixed income and non-US assets is of utmost importance amid growth risks. While the gold and commodities gained, the US dollar decline fueled the non-US equities, says Fidelity. As per Fidelity, the uncertainty regarding the direction of US policy impacted the financial markets during Q1, with investors digesting the news related to executive actions, such as tariff increases, deregulation announcements, reduced government staffing and programs, and tougher immigration activities. Also, the worries related to the economic effects of the tariff increases on the global economy saw an increase during the days after the quarter closed. Despite elevated growth risks, the global expansion was intact as of the close of Q1. Fidelity opines that diversification in fixed income assets and non-US assets is essential. As per the investment manager, the S&P 500 Index delivered a return of −4.3% for Q1 2025, partly because of the performance of growth stocks (−10%). On the other hand, gold (+19%) and commodities (+8.9%) saw robust gains amid higher market uncertainty. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. According to Fidelity, the consumer inflation remained rangebound at ~3% during Q1, which was well above the 2% target of the US Fed. The firm anticipates sticky inflation around 3% for the next year, with upside risk resulting from tariff increases. As per the firm, the consumer inflation expectations have increased to multi-decade highs, making it simpler for businesses to pass the increased costs. Coming to the labor, it has remained tight so far, despite increased policy uncertainty, government layoffs, and federal funding cuts, says Fidelity. On the supply side, the broader labor force participation has stalled below the pre-pandemic rate due to slowing immigration as well as demographic constraints. As per Marci McGregor, Head of Portfolio Strategy (Chief Investment Office), Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, the next few months can be a good time to play defense. The investors can consider defensive, dividend-paying, and value-oriented stocks. For the long term, the investors can position themselves for when the uncertainty around trade decreases. The volatility can provide a chance to buy assets supporting the long-term strategy at attractive prices, says McGregor. To list the 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we scanned the holdings of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and chose companies that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x.

Furthermore, the company demonstrated resilience with stable billed business growth as well as a robust performance in the travel and entertainment sectors, says Kennedy.

Its premium credit cards are more popular than ever, and its moderately affluent customer base continues to spend.

South Korea's domestic cryptocurrency market reached unprecedented valuations in December 2024, with the overall value of crypto assets in local wallets exceeding 100 trillion won. This is approximately $70.5 billion, according to a Bank of Korea (BOK) report cited by Busan Ilbo on April 22. This was the highest monthly total since the central bank began reporting crypto-related data and is approximately 2.2 times larger than last October when crypto assets in local wallets reached 58 trillion won, or $41 billion. According to the report, analysts attribute the quick turnover to the market excitement surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election in November and his public stances supporting crypto and other digital assets. President Trump's public stance on a pro-crypto position, including policy proposals intending to roll back restrictions on digital assets and promote the equivalent of digital assets in future blockchain innovations, has reportedly impacted the flow of money, not only in the U.S. but across the globe, especially in South Korea. The BOK indicated a clear surge in trading activity shortly after the elections. In the last week of December, the average trading volume reached 17.2 trillion won, which is approximately $12.1 billion—nearly five times larger than the average trading volume of October.

On the other hand, gold (+19%) and commodities (+8.9%) saw robust gains amid higher market uncertainty. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. According to Fidelity, the consumer inflation remained rangebound at ~3% during Q1, which was well above the 2% target of the US Fed. The firm anticipates sticky inflation around 3% for the next year, with upside risk resulting from tariff increases. As per the firm, the consumer inflation expectations have increased to multi-decade highs, making it simpler for businesses to pass the increased costs. Coming to the labor, it has remained tight so far, despite increased policy uncertainty, government layoffs, and federal funding cuts, says Fidelity. On the supply side, the broader labor force participation has stalled below the pre-pandemic rate due to slowing immigration as well as demographic constraints. As per Marci McGregor, Head of Portfolio Strategy (Chief Investment Office), Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, the next few months can be a good time to play defense. The investors can consider defensive, dividend-paying, and value-oriented stocks. For the long term, the investors can position themselves for when the uncertainty around trade decreases. The volatility can provide a chance to buy assets supporting the long-term strategy at attractive prices, says McGregor. To list the 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we scanned the holdings of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and chose companies that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q4 2024. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Forward P/E as of April 18: ~9.1x Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is engaged in providing communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities. Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant upped the company’s stock from “In Line” to “Outperform,” while raising its price target to $48 from $44. The company’s management remains recognized for the effective execution when it comes to improving the postpaid subscriber trends in the Consumer segment, gaining momentum in the Business wireless customers, and meeting the broadband subscriber targets. As per the analyst, the market is not fully appreciating Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)’s resilient wireless service revenue growth outlook, efforts related to the fiber expansion, and the potential strategic and financial benefits due to the Frontier acquisition. Overall, the analyst believes that wireless companies can continue to perform well, considering the current market uncertainty and downside risks. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) continues to make investments in lucrative fields, including Internet of Things (IoT) partnerships, 5G infrastructure, and fiber expansion. Third Point Management, a New York-based investment advisor, published its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “While some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka “wireless cable”) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing’s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper’s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.” Overall, VZ ranks 8th on our list of cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

YF_655900,Chimera Investment Corporation (CIM): Among the Dividend Paying Stocks Insiders Are Buying,no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chimera-investment-corporation-cim-among-150619696.html,2025-04-22 15:06:19,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Paying Stocks Insiders Are Buying. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM) stands against the other dividend paying stocks. Uncertainty is not among the market's favorites. Yet, at present, uncertainty is prevailing throughout the market. The U.S.-China trade escalation and the new tariffs on all other U.S. trading partners have left investors scrambling to find stable ground. READ ALSO: 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Just this week, CNBC reported President Trump's announcement to charge steep fees on ships built in China, presently docking at the U.S. ports, a move the analysts perceive could cause the shipping costs to go high and send a ripple through consumer prices. China, the significant retaliator to Trump's tariffs, has started targeting the U.S. service sector by threatening everything from tourism to tech talent pipelines. Even the blue-chip stocks find the current climate unfavorable, thus increasing the adoption rate of another strategy: dividend-paying stocks. And here's the kicker – insiders are loading up on them. Dividends are the financial shock absorbers when growth stocks swing wildly on trade war headlines. Investors in such an unfavorable market condition often prioritize the cash flow today rather than the promises of growth tomorrow. Historically, in many instances, when the market is experiencing turbulence, the dividend-paying stocks outperformed their non-dividend peers. In addition to padding the portfolio, the dividend stocks have signaled corporate resilience. And right now, insiders like executives and board members are betting big on the stability of the dividend stocks. Corporate leaders buy shares of their companies to add credibility to the stocks. At the same time, it also indicates that they see an undervalued potential in their stocks. Unlike analysts, the insiders have first-hand information regarding earnings forecasts, balance sheets, and the company's strategies that would allow it to weather the upcoming storms. The recent U.S.-China tariff escalations stand as a prime example of such storms. The headlines focus on the two countries' shipping fees and rare-earth export controls. Meanwhile, board members of some companies are scooping up stocks. But these are not speculative plays; they are calculated decisions made using the unique knowledge of the company's cash flows, debt, and history of raising dividends. Now, let us zoom out. The market position is clear. According to CNBC, volatility has become the new normal with China's retaliation squeezing the services trade sector, where the U.S. holds a $32 billion surplus. Finding an appropriate dividend that could add some resilience to the portfolio becomes a necessity. Using insider backing to find the best stock offers a rare blend of defensive positioning and growth potential. In this regard, we have done the legwork to uncover 10 dividend-paying stocks with high insider confidence. In addition to offering a positive yield, our picks could fortify your investments against the market chaos caused by the trade war. You may be hedging against inflation, chasing reliable income, or simply copying the moves of those in the know. When putting together our top 10 picks for the best dividend-paying stocks investors are buying, we followed a few criteria. We set the dividend yield at a minimum of 3%. This criterion is in place to provide investors with optimal income-generating stocks. We did not include stocks with an insider ownership change of less than 4% in the last six months since a larger percentage correlates with a significant shift in ownership, potentially based on recent and relevant information. Stocks with an average volume of over 200,000 are included in the list, suggesting much trading activity with strong interest from buyers and sellers. Additionally, we have considered only those stocks with a positive return on equity (ROE). With this criterion, we ensured that our picks generated income for the investments made by the shareholders. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 16, 2025. And we have ranked our picks based on the percentage change in insider ownership.

Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM) reported a GAAP net loss of $168.3 million in the Q4 of 2024. However, the quarterly dividend increased by 12%, indicating confidence in the company's financial health and a strong commitment to shareholders. The acquisition of the Palisades Group is expected to assist Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM) in diversifying its revenue stream by offering a new fee-based source of income that would elevate its earnings. Completing significant share repurchases and maintaining consistency in dividend payments has also earned the company confidence among shareholders and insiders. The company's plans for the year include diversifying the portfolio and increasing liquidity to stabilize its dividends amid the market volatility. Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM) insiders expressed their growing confidence in the company through an 8.14% increase in holdings.

Overall CIM ranks 1st on our list of the dividend paying stocks insiders are buying.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The broad-based market anxiety increased as the US policy uncertainty rose, says Fidelity. The financial markets were weighed down by tariff hikes, deregulation, and tighter immigration policies. The global business cycle is now less synchronized. As per the investment management firm, the US seemed to show mid- and late-cycle dynamics in Q1 2025. Furthermore, the diversification across fixed income and non-US assets is of utmost importance amid growth risks. While the gold and commodities gained, the US dollar decline fueled the non-US equities, says Fidelity. As per Fidelity, the uncertainty regarding the direction of US policy impacted the financial markets during Q1, with investors digesting the news related to executive actions, such as tariff increases, deregulation announcements, reduced government staffing and programs, and tougher immigration activities. Also, the worries related to the economic effects of the tariff increases on the global economy saw an increase during the days after the quarter closed. Despite elevated growth risks, the global expansion was intact as of the close of Q1. Fidelity opines that diversification in fixed income assets and non-US assets is essential. As per the investment manager, the S&P 500 Index delivered a return of −4.3% for Q1 2025, partly because of the performance of growth stocks (−10%).

An aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81 Forward P/E as of April 18: ~14.6x Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is engaged in integrated energy and chemicals operations.  Analyst Roger Read from Wells Fargo reiterated a “Buy” rating on the company’s stock. The analyst’s rating is being supported by the company’s strategic moves, which include the purchase of Hess shares, demonstrating confidence in future growth. Notably, between January and March 2025, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) purchased 15,380,000 shares of Hess Corporation common stock, implying ~4.99% of the shares of Hess common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2025. Amidst the macroeconomic uncertainties, including tariff disputes and volatile oil prices, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)’s stable cash flow and capital allocation strategies offer a robust foundation for continued investment, says Read. As per Morningstar, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is well-placed to deliver increased returns and greater FCF due to its oil-leveraged portfolio’s volume growth and margin expansion, improved operations, and cost reductions. The company has started oil and natural gas production from the Ballymore subsea tieback in the deepwater Gulf of America. Ballymore exhibits another step towards Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)’s goal to produce 300,000 net barrels per day of oil equivalent from the Gulf in 2026. Ballymore brings additional production online without building a new standalone offshore platform. This reduces the development costs and can fuel increased returns for shareholders. Overall, CVX ranks 6th on our list of cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

YF_209366,Is AT&T Inc. (T) the Cheap Blue Chip Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?,no summary,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-inc-t-cheap-blue-145137574.html,2025-04-22 14:51:37,"Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently published a list of 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) stands against other cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The broad-based market anxiety increased as the US policy uncertainty rose, says Fidelity. The financial markets were weighed down by tariff hikes, deregulation, and tighter immigration policies. The global business cycle is now less synchronized. As per the investment management firm, the US seemed to show mid- and late-cycle dynamics in Q1 2025. Furthermore, the diversification across fixed income and non-US assets is of utmost importance amid growth risks. While the gold and commodities gained, the US dollar decline fueled the non-US equities, says Fidelity. As per Fidelity, the uncertainty regarding the direction of US policy impacted the financial markets during Q1, with investors digesting the news related to executive actions, such as tariff increases, deregulation announcements, reduced government staffing and programs, and tougher immigration activities. Also, the worries related to the economic effects of the tariff increases on the global economy saw an increase during the days after the quarter closed. Despite elevated growth risks, the global expansion was intact as of the close of Q1. Fidelity opines that diversification in fixed income assets and non-US assets is essential. As per the investment manager, the S&P 500 Index delivered a return of −4.3% for Q1 2025, partly because of the performance of growth stocks (−10%). On the other hand, gold (+19%) and commodities (+8.9%) saw robust gains amid higher market uncertainty. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. According to Fidelity, the consumer inflation remained rangebound at ~3% during Q1, which was well above the 2% target of the US Fed. The firm anticipates sticky inflation around 3% for the next year, with upside risk resulting from tariff increases. As per the firm, the consumer inflation expectations have increased to multi-decade highs, making it simpler for businesses to pass the increased costs. Coming to the labor, it has remained tight so far, despite increased policy uncertainty, government layoffs, and federal funding cuts, says Fidelity. On the supply side, the broader labor force participation has stalled below the pre-pandemic rate due to slowing immigration as well as demographic constraints. As per Marci McGregor, Head of Portfolio Strategy (Chief Investment Office), Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, the next few months can be a good time to play defense. The investors can consider defensive, dividend-paying, and value-oriented stocks. For the long term, the investors can position themselves for when the uncertainty around trade decreases. The volatility can provide a chance to buy assets supporting the long-term strategy at attractive prices, says McGregor. To list the 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we scanned the holdings of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and chose companies that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q4 2024. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A person in the field using their smartphone to connect to wireless communication services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80 Forward P/E as of April 18: ~13.4x AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) offers telecommunications and technology services. Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan upped the company’s price objective to $30 from $29, keeping a “Strong Buy” rating. As per the analyst, the firm sees AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) as a value driver, with wireless growth and FCF ramp expected to bring investors back. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs reaffirmed a “Buy” rating on the company’s stock. This analyst has highlighted the company’s position as a favorable investment opportunity, mainly in the unpredictable market environment. Some of the notable factors contributing to such outlook include AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T)’s unique market share gains in the telecommunications sector and the defensive nature of the business. As per the analyst, the healthy dynamics in the wireless market can exceed Street estimates, thanks to the robust subscriber growth and higher pricing. Furthermore, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T)’s focused fiber strategy can ramp up broadband revenue growth, supporting its expedited network expansion plan. The company’s copper cost reduction initiative can significantly improve its profit margins, says the analyst. TCW Funds, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), based in Dallas, TX, is a nationwide provider of voice, video, and data communications services to businesses and consumers in the wired, wireless, and broadband. At initiation, the stock had a $141 billion market capitalization and met all five valuation factors with an above market dividend yield of 5.6%. From a sustainability prism, the company completed its commitment to invest $2 billion by the end of 2023 to help bridge the digital divide. AT&T is working on enabling low-income households to access to low-cost broadband services through its Access service plan as well as reaching out to more rural communities and Tribal lands where internet access remains a challenge. It is nearly 85% the way to providing one million people in need with digital resources through AT&T Connected Learning® with the goal to be reached by the end of 2025. In 2020, the company announced that it is committed to be carbon neutral by 2035 with zero carbon emission across all operations. It is deploying Smart Climate Solutions – through efforts like its Connected Climate Initiative – that will help enable its business customers to reduce their emissions as well. The company’s goal is to help collectively reduce its emissions by one billion metric tons – a gigaton – by 2035, compared to 2018 levels. The primary catalysts are new/strong management and restructuring. John Stankey was appointed CEO in July 2020 and he is committed to refocusing the company and improving its financial performance. The company combined its WarnerMedia operation with Discovery during 1Q:22 which eliminated AT&T’s exposure to the rapidly evolving media industry and refocused its core telecommunication business thus eliminating a major drag on profitability and the company’s balance sheet by reducing long-term debt from a peak $176 billion during 2020 to $142 billion at the end of June 2024 quarter. AT&T is moving aggressively to reduce cost and sell non-core assets such as its advertising platform Xander to Microsoft† which was accomplished during 2022. The company has redesigned its network to be software driven structure reducing the capital investment cycle in its national network – resulting in a network that is flexible with unrivaled speed and reliability – thus enhancing its nationwide position. By the end of 2023, it expanded its 5G network to reach more than 302 million people in nearly 24,500 cities and towns in the U.S. The company’s mid-band 5G+ network alone grew to cover more than 210 million people. AT&T is one of the largest investors in digital infrastructure in the U.S. Over the five years ending 2023, the company invested nearly $150 billion primarily in its wireless, fiber optics, and wireline networks. The extensive restructuring and refocusing of AT&T on its core business should result in improved earnings and cash flow while at the same time reducing uncertainty for shareholders.” Overall, T ranks 7th on our list of cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 96 Forward P/E as of April 18: ~11.3x Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is a financial services company that is engaged in providing diversified banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services. Evercore ISI analyst John Pancari has reiterated the bullish stance on the company’s stock, giving a “Buy” rating on April 8.

We recently published a list of 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against other cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The broad-based market anxiety increased as the US policy uncertainty rose, says Fidelity. The financial markets were weighed down by tariff hikes, deregulation, and tighter immigration policies. The global business cycle is now less synchronized. As per the investment management firm, the US seemed to show mid- and late-cycle dynamics in Q1 2025. Furthermore, the diversification across fixed income and non-US assets is of utmost importance amid growth risks. While the gold and commodities gained, the US dollar decline fueled the non-US equities, says Fidelity. As per Fidelity, the uncertainty regarding the direction of US policy impacted the financial markets during Q1, with investors digesting the news related to executive actions, such as tariff increases, deregulation announcements, reduced government staffing and programs, and tougher immigration activities. Also, the worries related to the economic effects of the tariff increases on the global economy saw an increase during the days after the quarter closed. Despite elevated growth risks, the global expansion was intact as of the close of Q1. Fidelity opines that diversification in fixed income assets and non-US assets is essential. As per the investment manager, the S&P 500 Index delivered a return of −4.3% for Q1 2025, partly because of the performance of growth stocks (−10%). On the other hand, gold (+19%) and commodities (+8.9%) saw robust gains amid higher market uncertainty. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. According to Fidelity, the consumer inflation remained rangebound at ~3% during Q1, which was well above the 2% target of the US Fed. The firm anticipates sticky inflation around 3% for the next year, with upside risk resulting from tariff increases. As per the firm, the consumer inflation expectations have increased to multi-decade highs, making it simpler for businesses to pass the increased costs. Coming to the labor, it has remained tight so far, despite increased policy uncertainty, government layoffs, and federal funding cuts, says Fidelity. On the supply side, the broader labor force participation has stalled below the pre-pandemic rate due to slowing immigration as well as demographic constraints.

Wolf Research upped the company’s stock to ‘Outperform’ from ‘Peer Perform,’ highlighting durable strengths in its core businesses even during broader worries related to recession. The firm lauded The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s long-term advantages throughout its theme parks, cruise lines, and streaming operations. Analyst Peter Supino of Wolfe Research opines that, in the entertainment business, the company can gain from the measures to restrict the practice of password sharing. Furthermore, the analyst expects tailwinds from linear TV’s decline and streaming bundles. The analyst opines that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s experiences business can benefit from launches of new cruise ships as well as updates to its theme parks. The company’s diverse content portfolio, consisting of strong franchises, offers a robust foundation for fueling streaming subscriber growth. Several of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s franchises have global popularity, aiding international expansion of the streaming services. Therefore, by effectively using its content portfolio throughout the streaming platforms, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) possesses the potential to grow its subscriber base, drive engagement, and reduce churn. ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its Q1 2025 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “While we had already begun to shift toward a more defensive positioning entering the quarter, we made a number of adjustments in response to the rapid-fire developments in both economic and political policy. Among our largest new positions during the period was The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), as we believe that it has turned a corner on building out its streaming service, which should help margins inflect higher and help drive better earnings than the market currently anticipates. The shift in management’s strategy, from “market share growth at all costs” to a more focused approach on improving pricing should also help to improve both profitability and margins, and we believe that there remains meaningful upside compared to other streaming service providers at similar scale.” Overall, DIS ranks 2nd on our list of cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds.
