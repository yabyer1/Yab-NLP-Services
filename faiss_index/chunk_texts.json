The Trump administration\u2019s decision to take a hammer to the funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty might be legally dubious, but politically pretty safe: Its programming wasn\u2019t intended to reach American audiences, so who would miss it, really? In September 2022, I came to Prague, in an unusual role of a volunteer media expert, to observe the operations of the Russian-language TV channel and online news portal, Current Time \u2014 one of the many brands under the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty umbrella. An American from Latvia whose native language is Russian, I had spent much of the previous decade trying to build bridges between the U.S. and Russian TV industries, a dream wiped out overnight with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Current Time had become an indispensable source of news for an audience misled by their own state media. Six months in, war coverage had pushed out almost all other reporting and fatigue was setting in. I wanted to be useful. If my knowledge of the Russian media could somehow help Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, I was happy to share it. Not to mention the fact that, as a lifelong fan of the band R.E.M., I\u2019d never pass up a chance to visit the organization that helped inspire their debut single, \u201cRadio Free Europe.\u201d The organization\u2019s headquarters was an imposing gray cube, just east of the city center. The general aura reminded me of a U.S. Embassy. It might be an editorially independent nongovernment entity, but its cultural and literal footprint was always that of an American values bulwark. I soon found I had landed in the middle of a philosophical debate. Would showing anything other than atrocities constitute catering to Russia? At the time of my arrival, the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty staff was considering starting a second channel that would run hard-hitting documentaries about Russian history and cruelties. I wondered who would be the audience for such depressing programming. A better tactic, I thought, would be to try to appeal to the persuadables, an audience many of whom had tuned out watching the news but retained a sense of right and wrong; an audience that Alexei Navalny, Russia\u2019s opposition leader, had sacrificed his freedom \u2014 and, soon, his life \u2014 trying to reach. The walls of the headquarters were lined not only with photos of the likes of Henry Kissinger and Hillary Clinton, but also Duke Ellington and Tom Jones. Indeed, the older generation of Soviet citizens retained warm memories of the \u201cenemy voices\u201d (as Radio Liberty, Voice of America, and the BBC\u2019s Russian Service were known) not because they delivered news from the West, but because they\u2019d play jazz and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Pop culture was the draw. I went back to the hotel and wrote out an email positing just that: What are the new areas of cultural scarcity? What have censorship and militarism taken away from the average young Russian? Some answers: uncensored stand-up comedy, freewheeling talk shows with no verboten topics and music by artists who hold opposition views. (Some, like my acquaintance, the rapper Ivan Dremin, a.k.a. FACE, were even declared \u201cforeign agents.\u201d) This initiative would also serve a secondary purpose. Since the start of the war, hundreds of thousands of Russia\u2019s most promising and conscientious citizens had left the country, many forgoing their careers in the process. This new platform I imagined could provide a lifeline to the artists among them and a diversion for the rest. And it should be a streaming and video-on-demand platform, functioning as a site, a mobile app, and a production hub using the artists\u2019 own YouTube channels for distribution. It turned out that someone at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty had been harboring a very similar vision. That someone was Stephen Capus, former president of NBC News and adviser to the United States Agency for Global Media, who had recently come onboard to consult for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Within weeks, we had written a proposal for this new media brand. It was approved almost instantly. It also created a fissure among the staff members, some of whom balked at \u201centertaining Russians.\u201d My volunteer effort became a job. The platform began in April 2023. Its earliest offerings included a concert film by FACE (naturally), who alternated hedonistic raps with serious statements and at some point unfurled a Ukrainian flag; a stand-up set by Ariana Lolaeva, a rising comedian from North Ossetia who had a criminal case against her back in Russia; music by Boris Grebenshchikov, a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll veteran with a Bob Dylan-like stature; and a Ukrainian documentary series about animals in war, anchored by Patron, the famous mine-sniffing dog. The last one, oddly enough, made the most important statement of all. It was one of the first instances of a Ukrainian collaboration with a Russophone media brand since the start of the war. Its very existence thus proclaimed two things: that a state was not its people, and that a Russian cultural platform could be unbound not only to Vladimir Putin but even to the Russian language. The name we picked for the service was Votvot. In Russian, the phrase \u201cvot-vot\u201d means both enthusiastic agreement, akin to \u201cexactly\u201d or the German \u201cgenau,\u201d and something like \u201cany minute now,\u201d which some chose to read as a cheeky prediction of systemic change. The platform had an unofficial motto: \u201cIf the Kremlin hates it, we have it.\u201d There is, certainly, room for discussion on whether financing foreign-facing media is a proper use of U.S. taxpayer money. In order to have this discussion in good faith, however, it\u2019s necessary to establish what kind of money we\u2019re talking about. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u2019s entire annual operating budget in 2024 was $142 million, which covered a staff of more than 1,700 and services reaching 47 million weekly users in 27 languages. Votvot cost around $2 million a year, including all content and salaries. (For context, this is about 1/9000th of Netflix\u2019s projected content budget this year). The Votvot team consisted of far-flung freelancers in places including Tbilisi, Georgia; Barcelona, Spain; Belgrade, Serbia; and Berlin. Several of them worked from Ukraine. We had more than a few editorial meetings from which someone had to excuse themselves early to head to a bomb shelter. One young woman was still in Moscow at the time of her hiring. I was gingerly explaining the risks of working with \u201cforeign agents\u201d over a Zoom when she lifted her hand into the frame to adjust her hair. Her fingernails were painted the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. Here, I knew, was someone utterly fearless. Within a few months, the job allowed her to leave Russia. On Feb. 20, 2024, the Russian authorities declared all of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty an \u201cundesirable organization.\u201d This designation was an escalation from \u201cforeign agent\u201d and just below \u201cextremist organization.\u201d (Instagram is also seen as extremist.) This meant that it was now illegal to share or comment on the content. Imagine trying to go viral when your viewers might be fined or jailed for pressing \u201clike.\u201d Worried about the safety of both our creators and our audience, we put up new content without advertising it.  As time went by and the war dragged on, the chasm between the Russians who stayed and the Russians who left kept growing. Many of those on the inside began to think of the ones on the outside as privileged and out of touch. A common critique of all media projects headquartered abroad is that this is just the diaspora talking to itself. Yet only those outside of Mr. Putin\u2019s reach could sing, play or joke without being censored or censoring themselves. Votvot launched its first proper publicity campaign in September 2024. At that point, the content streaming on its platform included the Oscar-winning documentary \u201c20 Days in Mariupol,\u201d to which it held rights in 15 countries, and dozens of exclusive films, concerts and shows. Two months later, the United States restored Donald Trump to the presidency. Soon after his inauguration, Trump realigned America\u2019s policies towards both Russia and Ukraine, and also decided the service is no longer worth paying for. It\u2019s reasonable to infer that the real issue, in the administration\u2019s eyes, is probably not the cost of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u2019s programming, but what they called its far-left values (this, about an organization whose entire existence is based on fighting Communism). Starting on April 1, about half of its employees have been furloughed, freelancers dismissed and the Votvot experiment frozen. At the end, it had well over a million unique users. The satellite services that broadcast its programs to Russia were turned off on April 4. Mr. Capus, who had become the organization\u2019s president in January 2024, is spearheading the effort to save its funding. But it\u2019s not just the consumers of our content that have lost. Having worked for an \u201cenemy,\u201d many of the creators could face repercussions at home, and their ability to stay abroad is often dependent on their employment-based visa status. Some are probably safe in Spain and Germany; others are in Georgia and Serbia, countries that could very well be more susceptible to Russian influence. For a short while we were able to empower fearless creators to speak up against war and push back against censorship. Some may see this as government waste. I happen to see it as a smart investment in a generation that will one day run a post-Putin Russia \u2014 and is instead learning a lesson in American duplicity.

Reporting from Toronto When Canadians vote in parliamentary elections on April 28, they will essentially be choosing between two starkly different candidates to lead their country through a crisis brought on by President Trump\u2019s tariffs and festering economic and social issues. Mark Carney, 60, the Liberal Party leader who has been serving as prime minister since early March, is a political novice. He has had a long career in central banking and global finance. Pierre Poilievre, 45, the Conservative Party leader, has been a politician for most of his adult life and is well known to voters, having meticulously curated his agenda, talking points and image. Two other candidates are vying to maintain their parties\u2019 representation in Parliament: Jagmeet Singh of the New Democrats, a leftist party that has focused much of its campaign on health care, and Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which runs candidates only in Quebec. But Mr. Poilievre and Mr. Carney are widely acknowledged to be the only two who can gain enough support to become prime minister. Mr. Carney is a former central banker who made his first foray into politics by winning the support of Liberal Party members to replace Justin Trudeau as the party\u2019s leader last month.

The acclaimed filmmaker discusses bringing death to the forefront in his latest picture. Credit... In 2017, during the funeral of his wife and longtime collaborator Carolyn Zeifman, the director David Cronenberg found himself struck by an unusual impulse: As the coffin holding her dead body was lowered into the ground, he wanted more than anything to get into that box with her. That reluctance to let go is taken to even more morbid extremes in Cronenberg\u2019s new movie, \u201cThe Shrouds,\u201d about a high-tech cemetery where the ongoing decomposition of a corpse can be viewed through a video livestream meant for the loved ones left behind. When those graves are mysteriously vandalized, it\u2019s up to the cemetery owner Karsh (Vincent Cassel) to determine the culprits, who he suspects may have something to do with the death of his own wife (Diane Kruger). The 82-year-old Cronenberg has always been guided by a unique point of view as a filmmaker, and his classics like \u201cScanners,\u201d \u201cVideodrome\u201d and \u201cThe Fly\u201d helped establish the body-horror genre. Still, he admitted in an interview via Zoom this month that \u201cThe Shrouds\u201d could be considered one of his most personal films: It\u2019s not for nothing that Cassel is costumed to look like his director, donning dark suits and teasing his gray hair upward in a familiar manner. Even so, Cronenberg cautioned against drawing too many links between himself and his lead character. \u201cAs soon as you start to write a screenplay, you\u2019re writing fiction, no matter what the impetus was in your own life,\u201d Cronenberg said. \u201cSuddenly, you\u2019re creating characters that need to come to life. And when you start to write them, they start to push you around if they\u2019re really alive.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-19_921668_1": "Tariffs Some young adults with disposable incomes for the first time in their lives are trying to make sense of how tariffs are affecting how they should save and spend. In the house group chat, usually a scroll of memes, reminders and dinner plans, one of Jack Kankiewicz\u2019s roommates dropped a screenshot of an article about President Trump\u2019s tariffs to global trading partners announced on April 2. Mr. Kankiewicz and his roommates debated the tariffs\u2019 possible effects, and then returned to their usual discussions, with one roommate confirming that they would indeed be getting McDonald\u2019s before seeing \u201cA Minecraft Movie.\u201d Previously, tariffs were something Mr. Kankiewicz might only expect to hear from his friends majoring in political science. But since Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, he said, it has entered his everyday lexicon. \u201cMy roommates and I have been tapping in a little more,\u201d said Mr. Kankiewicz, 22. He realized he didn\u2019t have a full understanding of tariffs, so he did some internet research to figure out how they might affect him, finding speculation on the rising prices of goods and a worsening job market. People in their 20s viscerally understand that an economy is not solid matter on which to stand. They saw their families go through the 2008 financial crisis in elementary and middle school, then the Covid pandemic in high school and college. Over the last two weeks, with tariffs announced, then suspended, the stock market swinging with each announcement\u2019s wake, many young adults have begun considering changing their habits around spending and saving to prepare for an uncertain economy.

  "2025-04-19_238144_1": "retiring Losing your home in a disaster when you\u2019re at or near retirement age can derail your finances and jeopardize the funds you were counting on. Sandra and Tom Johnson were at home in Los Angeles County one January night, watching the news of the Palisades fire on television, when a neighbor knocked on the door. He wanted them to see it: flames in the mountains in nearby Eaton Canyon. Within the hour, firefighters ordered the Johnsons to leave their home in the community of Altadena. \u201cWe just had to forget our stuff, grab our dog and run,\u201d said Ms. Johnson, 72, a retired mail truck driver for the Los Angeles Unified School District. The couple sped off while fire consumed their home of 49 years, as well as the yard studded with fruit trees and vegetable patches that Mr. Johnson, 76, had meticulously tended. They went to their daughter\u2019s house in Palmdale, an hour north, and almost four months later, they\u2019re still there. As they contemplate their next move, one thing feels clear: They are not going back and rebuilding. It\u2019s a particularly fraught calculation for those 50 and older. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard at this age to wait years and years and years to be back to normal,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. Over the course of one short week, the Palisades fire, on the west side of Los Angeles County, and the Eaton fire, on the east side, destroyed more than 16,000 structures and damaged over 2,000 more, according to the state. Not counted in that tally are homes the blaze skirted, but are still uninhabitable because of smoke damage and a lack of utilities. That translates to tens of thousands of households trying rebuild or sell at a time when federal tariff and immigration policies could make constructing homes more complicated and expensive.

  "2025-04-19_297634_1": "What to Watch Movies and TV productions are rapidly leaving California to film outside the United States, where labor costs are lower and tax incentives greater. Industry workers are exasperated. Reporting from Los Angeles It would have been simple to shoot the game show \u201cThe Floor\u201d in Los Angeles. The city has many idle studios that could have easily accommodated its large display screen and the midnight-blue tiles that light up beneath contestants. But Fox flies the show\u2019s host, Rob Lowe, and 100 American contestants thousands of miles across the Atlantic Ocean to answer trivia questions about dogs, divas and Disney characters at a studio in Dublin. It makes more financial sense than filming in California.

Those business decisions have considerable consequences for the industry\u2019s thousands of middle-class workers: the camera operators, set decorators and lighting technicians who make movies and television happen. Frustration has reached a boiling point, according to more than two dozen people who make their living in the entertainment industry.

I am not a dramatist, even though I\u2019m in the drama field.\u201d Productions have been filmed outside the United States for decades, but rarely has Hollywood work been so bustling overseas at a time when work in Hollywood itself has been so scant.

Political leaders in New York have been promising an overhaul of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan for so long that the saga has started to resemble the Arthurian legend of the sword in the stone. One by one, officials have tried to pull off ambitious renovation schemes, and one by one they have failed. On Thursday, President Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Sean P.

  "2025-04-18_82209_1": "Two regulators signed off on the $35 billion deal, which the banks say will create a competitor to Visa and Mastercard. But consumer advocates warn that the deal may raise costs. Two of the country\u2019s largest credit card companies are poised to merge after key banking regulators approved the deal on Friday, despite concern among some advocacy groups and lawmakers that it could lead to higher fees and less choice for consumers. Capital One received the green light from the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to acquire Discover Financial Services in a roughly $35 billion deal announced in February 2024. Capital One, the nation\u2019s ninth-largest bank, with $479 billion in assets, issues credit cards on networks run by Visa and Mastercard. Acquiring Discover will give it access to a credit card network of 305 million cardholders, adding to its base of more than 100 million customers. The banks, which said they expected the deal to close on May 18, have argued that the merger would create a stronger competitor to the giants in the network space: Visa and Mastercard. The deal will \u201cincrease competition in payment networks, offer a wider range of products to our customers, increase our resources devoted to innovation and security, and bring meaningful community benefits,\u201d Michael Shepherd, the interim chief executive of Discover, said in a statement on Friday. But after the deal was announced, it was swiftly met with concerns from consumer advocates about concentration in the credit card market, since the country\u2019s biggest credit card issuer would control its own network. \u201cThe feds got this one wrong \u2014 so it falls to state attorneys general to intervene against the harmful, anticompetitive Capital One-Discover merger,\u201d Jesse Van Tol, the chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said in a statement. The group, which promotes access to banking services, has opposed the deal since it was announced. In announcing its approval, the Fed also said it had fined Discover $100 million for overcharging certain interchange fees \u2014 transaction fees that a merchant\u2019s bank pays to the credit card-issuing bank \u2014 from 2007 to 2023. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in a statement on Friday, said its approval of the deal was conditional on the banks\u2019 addressing \u201cthe root causes of any outstanding enforcement actions against Discover Bank and remediation of harm.\u201d Capital One cleared another significant obstacle to its acquisition of Discover after the Justice Department, which also has authority to block banking deals, told regulators this month that it didn\u2019t see sufficient competition concerns to block the merger. Banking analysts said the move indicated that Trump administration regulators might be more open than the Biden administration to bank mergers. During the Biden administration, the Justice Department told regulators that it was concerned, in part, about the deal\u2019s impact on potential credit card users who had no credit. In the last months of the administration, the department moved to tighten oversight of banking deals, placing more stringent guidelines on how it evaluates banking deals \u2014 the first update to that framework since 2008. In February, shareholders of both companies approved the all-stock deal, which was valued at roughly $35 billion when it was announced last year.

  "YF_359911_1": "Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Paying Stocks Insiders Are Buying.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mach Natural Resources LP (NYSE:MNR) stands against the other dividend paying stocks. Uncertainty is not among the market's favorites. Yet, at present, uncertainty is prevailing throughout the market. The U.S.-China trade escalation and the new tariffs on all other U.S. trading partners have left investors scrambling to find stable ground. READ ALSO: 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Just this week, CNBC reported President Trump's announcement to charge steep fees on ships built in China, presently docking at the U.S. ports, a move the analysts perceive could cause the shipping costs to go high and send a ripple through consumer prices. China, the significant retaliator to Trump's tariffs, has started targeting the U.S. service sector by threatening everything from tourism to tech talent pipelines. Even the blue-chip stocks find the current climate unfavorable, thus increasing the adoption rate of another strategy: dividend-paying stocks. And here's the kicker \u2013 insiders are loading up on them. Dividends are the financial shock absorbers when growth stocks swing wildly on trade war headlines. Investors in such an unfavorable market condition often prioritize the cash flow today rather than the promises of growth tomorrow. Historically, in many instances, when the market is experiencing turbulence, the dividend-paying stocks outperformed their non-dividend peers. In addition to padding the portfolio, the dividend stocks have signaled corporate resilience. And right now, insiders like executives and board members are betting big on the stability of the dividend stocks. Corporate leaders buy shares of their companies to add credibility to the stocks. At the same time, it also indicates that they see an undervalued potential in their stocks. Unlike analysts, the insiders have first-hand information regarding earnings forecasts, balance sheets, and the company's strategies that would allow it to weather the upcoming storms. The recent U.S.-China tariff escalations stand as a prime example of such storms. The headlines focus on the two countries' shipping fees and rare-earth export controls. Meanwhile, board members of some companies are scooping up stocks. But these are not speculative plays; they are calculated decisions made using the unique knowledge of the company's cash flows, debt, and history of raising dividends. Now, let us zoom out. The market position is clear. According to CNBC, volatility has become the new normal with China's retaliation squeezing the services trade sector, where the U.S. holds a $32 billion surplus. Finding an appropriate dividend that could add some resilience to the portfolio becomes a necessity. Using insider backing to find the best stock offers a rare blend of defensive positioning and growth potential. In this regard, we have done the legwork to uncover 10 dividend-paying stocks with high insider confidence. In addition to offering a positive yield, our picks could fortify your investments against the market chaos caused by the trade war. You may be hedging against inflation, chasing reliable income, or simply copying the moves of those in the know. When putting together our top 10 picks for the best dividend-paying stocks investors are buying, we followed a few criteria. We set the dividend yield at a minimum of 3%. This criterion is in place to provide investors with optimal income-generating stocks. We did not include stocks with an insider ownership change of less than 4% in the last six months since a larger percentage correlates with a significant shift in ownership, potentially based on recent and relevant information. Stocks with an average volume of over 200,000 are included in the list, suggesting much trading activity with strong interest from buyers and sellers. Additionally, we have considered only those stocks with a positive return on equity (ROE). With this criterion, we ensured that our picks generated income for the investments made by the shareholders. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 16, 2025. And we have ranked our picks based on the percentage change in insider ownership. A large natural gas pipeline snaking through a rural landscape. Change in Insider Ownership: 7.25% Dividend Yield: 18.55% Headquartered in Oklahoma City, Mach Natural Resources LP (NYSE:MNR) is an independent upstream energy company focusing on the acquisition, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and NGLs in the Anadarko Basin. The company operates a stable asset base and competes with players like Dorchester Minerals, Devon Energy, and Continental Resources for market share. The company generates consistent free cash flow through disciplined capital deployment and a focus on legacy assets with low decline rates, thus gaining a competitive edge over its peers. Mach Natural Resources LP (NYSE:MNR) generated $235 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Completing the acquisition of over one million acres of land and significant infrastructure has contributed to the EBITDA of $78 million in 2024. The lift and operating expenses on all the acquisitions were reduced between 25% and 35%, leading to the company's elevated operational efficiency. Additionally, the distribution of over $1 billion to unitholders highlights the company's commitment to maximizing cash distribution, instilling confidence in the stock. For 2025, the company has planned to operate three rigs with a capital expenditure budget between $225 and $240 million. Mach Natural Resources LP (NYSE:MNR) saw a 7.25% change in insider ownership, reflecting a surge in insider confidence. The stock stands out as one of the best dividend stocks for aggressive yield hunters, with a dividend yield of 18.55%. Overall MNR ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the dividend paying stocks insiders are buying. While we acknowledge the potential of MNR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Not negotiating your starting salary at a new job could cause you to miss out on thousands of dollars a year \u2014 if not more. Add that amount up over the course of multiple years or decades and you could be losing out on a substantial amount of cash. Discover More: Here\u2019s How To Use AI To Quickly Start a Side Gig, According to Codie Sanchez Find Out: 12 SUVs With the Most Reliable Engines More than half (55%) of people don\u2019t negotiate their first salary, according to Resume Genius\u2019 2025 Salary Negotiation and Expectations Survey of 1,000 full-time U.S. workers. Here are the other key findings of the survey, as well as some well-known strategies for negotiating salaries during the hiring process. Even though more people are starting to negotiate salaries during the hiring process, it\u2019s still not as common as you might think. Roughly 45% of survey respondents negotiate their starting salary, while 55% people simply accept what they\u2019re offered. Other key findings include: Seventy-eight percent of those who negotiate receive a better offer. Fifty-one percent get an offer matching what they ask for. Just 22% of those who negotiate don\u2019t receive a better offer. The survey also found that men (51%) are more likely to negotiate than women (39%). Interestingly, when women do negotiate, they often end up getting better results: A whopping 82% of women who negotiate get a better offer, compared to 76% of men. Fifty-four percent of women who negotiate receive a matching offer, compared to 50% of men. Age appears to play a role in people\u2019s willingness to negotiate their starting salary, as well: Fifty-five percent of Gen Z negotiate. Forty-eight percent of millennials negotiate. Forty-two percent of Gen X and baby boomers negotiate. Again, the majority of people who negotiate get a higher starting salary. Read Next: I Made $10,000 Using One of Dave Ramsey\u2019s Best Passive Income Ideas Perhaps unsurprisingly, most people (57%) regret either not negotiating or asking for more during the process. Nearly a third (30%) say they wish they\u2019d negotiated more, but still felt it was the best decision at the time. About a quarter (27%) of those who didn\u2019t negotiate at all regret not doing so. If you feel like you deserve a certain starting salary but aren\u2019t sure how to go about it, here are some top strategies to consider: Know What You\u2019re Worth. Before going to a job interview or applying for a job with a low salary, make a list of the experience and skills you can talk about. Look into typical salaries in your area based on experience. Compare Salaries. Use a site like Glassdoor or Payscale to find what companies in your industry and area are offering. Know Your Rights. Pay transparency laws exist to help you get a fair offer. Check with the U.S. Department of Labor or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to see the state or regional laws. Use Tact When Discussing Salary. If the interviewer asks what you expect, tell them you\u2019re willing to negotiate or are comfortable with the listed salary range. If they don\u2019t have a range, ask about their budget. Be Prepared To Demonstrate Your Worth. This means preparing before the interview. Conduct mock interviews with a friend about how your experiences align with the job \u2014 and make you the best candidate (and worth a higher salary). Come With Your Own Salary Range. Sometimes, you might have to come to the table with your acceptable minimum salary. Give a range of the salary you\u2019d accept based on your experience and what other companies are offering. Don\u2019t Overshare. Keep your previous or current salary to yourself. Otherwise, a potential employer might use that to give you a lowball offer. Be Open To Negotiate. If you receive a low offer but still want to proceed with the opportunity, see if you can bridge the gap. If the company can\u2019t increase the base pay, consider other compensation \u2014 like stock options or retirement contributions. These can add up, too.

We recently published a list of the 11 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other promising long-term stocks. On March 31, Banrion\u2019s Shana Sissel recently appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Power Lunch\u2019 to discuss that buying at lower valuations is favorable for long-term investors. Shana Sissel highlighted that the markets now want transparency, given the persistent volatility that has lasted for a while now. When this clarity is lacking, it becomes difficult for investors and businesses to plan for the long term. This uncertainty has led to soft consumer and CEO confidence, which makes it challenging to develop long-term strategies when key aspects such as industrial policy, business policy, and taxes remain unresolved in the US. Sissel emphasized that until there is more certainty, volatility is likely to persist. She expressed skepticism that any immediate announcements would provide the level of information investors desire, especially because of the administration\u2019s habit of making statements that are later contradicted or revised. However, Sissel pointed out that long-term investors can find attractive buying opportunities if they look beyond the current uncertainty. She noted that the recent drop in valuations for many tech stocks now presents favorable buying opportunities for long-term investors. Regardless of the short-term fluctuations in policy uncertainty, many tech and security companies still benefit from long-term demand due to trends like the ongoing adoption of AI and the growing need for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection. Even when government decisions are unclear, these sectors are resilient because their products and services address fundamental needs that are unlikely to change with fluctuating market cycles. We first sifted through the Finviz stock screener and financial media reports to compile a list of the top stocks with high upside potential of over 40%. We then selected 11 stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 20%. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024, which was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. Note: All data was sourced on April 21.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 39.48% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 Average Upside Potential as of April 21: 65.53% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company that offers graphics and compute & networking solutions internationally. It sells its products to original equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators and distributors, independent software vendors, cloud service providers, consumer internet companies, and others. The growing adoption of NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell architecture is driving its revenue. In FQ4 2025, Blackwell\u2019s revenue totaled $11 billion, which marked the fastest product ramp in the company\u2019s history. Blackwell delivers ~25 times higher token throughput and 20 times lower cost than the Hopper 100 for reasoning AI. Large cloud service providers like Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI are deploying Blackwell systems to meet their growing demand for AI infrastructure. The overall Data Center segment at NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) made a record $35.6 billion in revenue in FQ4, which was a 93% year-over-year improvement. For the entire fiscal year 2025, the revenue doubled. However, Argus lowered the stock\u2019s price target to $150 from $175 while keeping a Buy rating on April 17. The firm believes that the fresh US licensing requirements for AI chip exports, which include NVIDIA\u2019s H20 models, will potentially impact quarterly earnings by as much as $55 billion. Guinness Global Innovators is highly bullish on NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to its dominant AI chip market position. It stated the following in its Q4 2024\u00a0investor letter: \u201cFor a second year running,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund\u2019s top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia\u2019s \u2018Hopper\u2019 GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current \u2018Hopper\u2019 GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia\u2019s extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to \u201cinference\u201d (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia\u2019s financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia\u2019s data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia\u2019s technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the 11 most promising long-term stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

By Ashitha Shivaprasad and Anjana Anil (Reuters) -Gold's remarkable run higher is reaching new heights, with the market touching $3,500 per ounce as confidence in the U.S. economy further erodes after President Donald Trump's renewed attack on the Federal Reserve chair. Spot gold was trading around $3,428 per ounce by 1417 GMT, after hitting a record $3,500.05 earlier in the session. Trump said on Monday the U.S. economy could slow down unless interest rates are lowered immediately, repeating his criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell as being slow to act and calling him a \"major loser\". That was followed by a furious flight from U.S. assets which undermined Wall Street and the dollar, while concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve piled fresh pressure on Treasuries. [USD/] [MKTS/GLOB] \"Gold is recalibrating to reflect what can only be described as epic changes in the global financial system. And those changes are a widespread and fundamental shift in confidence in the world\u2019s reserve currency and its bond markets,\" said independent analyst Ross Norman. Bullion, renowned as a hedge against uncertainties and a highly liquid asset, has surged more than $800 since the start of the year. It surpassed $3,300 last Wednesday, and its strong momentum pushed it up by nearly $200 in just a few days. CENTRAL BANK DEMAND Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, said central bank demand \"is very likely chasing gold's move higher, because Trump 2.0\u2019s chaos only hardens gold\u2019s appeal as a geopolitical asset\". In the final quarter of 2024, when Trump won the U.S. election, central bank purchases accelerated 54% year-on-year to 333 tons, according to an estimate from the World Gold Council. Data showed that China's central bank added gold to its reserves in March for the fifth straight month. China is considering setting up overseas warehouses to aid international settlement of specific products on the Shanghai Gold Exchange, its central bank said. CORRECTION - LIKELY TO BE SHORT-LIVED Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs increased its year-end gold forecast to $3,700. It added that if central bank buying averages 100 tonnes/month, it estimates gold could reach $3,810 by end-2025. ANZ last week also raised its year-end gold price forecast to $3,600. Asked about a pause in the rally, analysts and experts said any correction is likely to be short-lived, and greater gains are most likely on the horizon if instability persists. \"It is hard just now to see a scenario where gold could correct sharply lower as a physical floor of Johnny-come-lately buyers would support or cushion the decline,\" said Norman. Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said a major road block for gold \"would be a less confrontative President Trump, either on the side of trade or on the side of monetary policy - both of which seem rather unlikely at the moment\". Spot gold has hit 28 record highs so far in 2025, of which 16 are above the $3,000/oz milestone. Prices are up 31% so far this year, after ending 2024 with a 27% annual rise.

  "YF_75799_1": "BREAKING: Futures Mixed After Stocks Extend Gains IBM (IBM) will report first-quarter earnings late Wednesday. Despite the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average slumping this year, IBM stock has held on to its gains \u2014 a trend some on Wall Street expect to continue. IBM stock has gained 7% year-to-date, outperforming a 10% loss from the S&P 500. Shares of the more than century-old tech company rallied 35% last year, helped by Wall Street's increasing confidence the tech giant can benefit from AI demand. Shares returned to record highs for the first time in a decade. On the stock market today, IBM stock is up more than 2% at 241.30. IBM hasn't been completely spared from concerns about the broader economy, however. Shares are down 11% from a high of 265.72 reached in early February. IBM stock took a hit last month after technology consulting rival\u00a0Accenture (ACN)\u00a0warned U.S. government business could see slower growth, citing broad federal spending cuts promised by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's DOGE initiative. But some analysts have noted that IBM historically holds up when markets get choppy. \"IBM remains attractive and has historically outperformed peers in 2000, 2008 and 2020,\" BofA Securities Wamsi Mohan said in a client note earlier this month. \"Additionally, only 10% of their COGS (cost of goods sold) spend is hardware and most of their manufacturing is U.S. based.\" Mohan holds a buy rating for IBM stock. Here's what to watch ahead of IBM's first quarter report: Overall, analysts polled by FactSet expect IBM to post adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share, down 15% from a year earlier. Analysts project revenue will decrease by fraction year-over-year, to $14.4 billion for the quarter. IBM's software division is project to have the strongest quarter, with 7.5% year-over-year revenue growth. But that could be weighed down by the 10.2% decrease in infrastructure related sales for revenue that analysts are projecting, according to FactSet. Consulting revenue is also projected to decrease, by 2.6%. IBM's software division is its largest revenue source, with analysts projecting software sales will account for 44% of IBM's first quarter revenue. Consulting is seen accounting for 35% of sales and infrastructure 19%. Ahead of its report, IBM has a buy rating from 12 of the 22 analysts following the stock, according to FactSet. It has neutral calls from six analysts and sell warnings from four analysts. The average target price of 255.50 among all analysts implies about 8% upside from IBM stock's closing price Monday. Evercore ISI's Amit Daryanani is among the analysts who are bullish on IBM. He told clients on Monday that he expects IBM to perform in-line with consensus estimates for the first quarter, helped by strong software performance. \"We think IBM should fare better vs. peers given their mostly (Fortune 500) customer base and high mix of recurring software/consulting revenue, while we think potential tariff impact within infrastructure should be manageable,\" Daryanani wrote. However, he added, \"one area of potential softness could be IBM's Consulting segment given federal government spend efficiency efforts (U.S. federal government is roughly 5% of total revenue).\" But \"AI tailwinds\" for IBM's software business could help offset those concerns, Daryanani wrote. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring on Tuesday reiterated a neutral equal-weight call and price target of 237 for IBM stock. \"Amidst a challenging fundamental backdrop, IBM likely maintains safe-haven status with a largely in-line Q1/Q2 and no change to full year guidance,\" Woodring wrote. Earlier this month, Woodring and Morgan Stanley's IT sector analysts lowered their price targets for 15 of the 16 stocks they cover in response to President Donald Trump tariffs. IBM was the exception, with the analysts actually increasing their IBM price target to 237 from 228. The analysts expect IBM can \"weather today's volatility,\" Woodring wrote on April 8, but still see \"limited valuation or estimate upside, which keeps us equal-weight rated.\" Meanwhile, IBM stock has a \"Blue Dot\" on its Relative Strength line, according to MarketSurge charts from Investor's Business Daily. Relative Strength measures a stock performance compared with the rest of the market. The RS Line Blue Dot shows strong outperformance vs. the benchmark S&P 500 index. IBM stock's Relative Strength Rating checks in at 91 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. That indicates IBM stock has outperformed 91% of stocks tracked by IBD over the past 12 months. Further, IBM stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 82 out a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

  "YF_448410_1": "Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bank of America shareholders voted on Tuesday to approve pay packages for CEO Brian Moynihan and the lender's top executives, and also elected its 14 directors on the board. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended that investors vote against the payouts, expressing concerns about the process used to set the compensation. Moynihan earned $35 million for last year, an increase of roughly 21%. The company's board credited him with growing its net income 2.3% last year and boosting revenue 3.4%. On U.S. plans to impose tariffs on trading partners, Moynihan said any impact on the bank will be indirect - on how a trade war affects the economy. \"The impact on our bank will be through the economic impact of a trade war... so if you believe that consumption falls and that results in reductions in force of employees and unemployment rate would go up,\" he said. The administration of President Donald Trump earlier this month announced, then paused, sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, throwing the global economy into a state of uncertainty. Moynihan reiterated that the bank's economic team does not see a recession this year, but expects the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates because inflation is sticky. Regarding a question about the risk of Trump sacking Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the CEO said an independent central bank is one of the important things about U.S. consistency. Trump stepped up his criticism of Fed Chair Powell for not cutting interest rates, calling him a \"major loser\", in a social media post on Monday, which raised concerns about the president's influence over the central bank. BofA's shareholders also voted on other management proposals, but rejected all individual shareholder proposals. These individual proposals included a request to the board to annually report on the alignment of its lobbying and policy influence activities with regard to its 2030 sectoral emissions reduction and 2050 net zero targets. BofA had joined other major U.S. banks to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, one of the world's top banking sector climate coalitions in recent months. BofA topped estimates for first-quarter profit as interest income grew and volatile markets helped its stock traders rake in a record haul.

  "YF_42122_1": "Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Paying Stocks Insiders Are Buying.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ashland Inc. (NYSE:ASH) stands against the other dividend paying stocks. Uncertainty is not among the market's favorites. Yet, at present, uncertainty is prevailing throughout the market. The U.S.-China trade escalation and the new tariffs on all other U.S. trading partners have left investors scrambling to find stable ground. READ ALSO: 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Just this week, CNBC reported President Trump's announcement to charge steep fees on ships built in China, presently docking at the U.S. ports, a move the analysts perceive could cause the shipping costs to go high and send a ripple through consumer prices. China, the significant retaliator to Trump's tariffs, has started targeting the U.S. service sector by threatening everything from tourism to tech talent pipelines. Even the blue-chip stocks find the current climate unfavorable, thus increasing the adoption rate of another strategy: dividend-paying stocks. And here's the kicker \u2013 insiders are loading up on them. Dividends are the financial shock absorbers when growth stocks swing wildly on trade war headlines. Investors in such an unfavorable market condition often prioritize the cash flow today rather than the promises of growth tomorrow. Historically, in many instances, when the market is experiencing turbulence, the dividend-paying stocks outperformed their non-dividend peers. In addition to padding the portfolio, the dividend stocks have signaled corporate resilience. And right now, insiders like executives and board members are betting big on the stability of the dividend stocks. Corporate leaders buy shares of their companies to add credibility to the stocks. At the same time, it also indicates that they see an undervalued potential in their stocks. Unlike analysts, the insiders have first-hand information regarding earnings forecasts, balance sheets, and the company's strategies that would allow it to weather the upcoming storms. The recent U.S.-China tariff escalations stand as a prime example of such storms. The headlines focus on the two countries' shipping fees and rare-earth export controls. Meanwhile, board members of some companies are scooping up stocks. But these are not speculative plays; they are calculated decisions made using the unique knowledge of the company's cash flows, debt, and history of raising dividends. Now, let us zoom out. The market position is clear. According to CNBC, volatility has become the new normal with China's retaliation squeezing the services trade sector, where the U.S. holds a $32 billion surplus. Finding an appropriate dividend that could add some resilience to the portfolio becomes a necessity. Using insider backing to find the best stock offers a rare blend of defensive positioning and growth potential. In this regard, we have done the legwork to uncover 10 dividend-paying stocks with high insider confidence. In addition to offering a positive yield, our picks could fortify your investments against the market chaos caused by the trade war. You may be hedging against inflation, chasing reliable income, or simply copying the moves of those in the know. When putting together our top 10 picks for the best dividend-paying stocks investors are buying, we followed a few criteria. We set the dividend yield at a minimum of 3%. This criterion is in place to provide investors with optimal income-generating stocks. We did not include stocks with an insider ownership change of less than 4% in the last six months since a larger percentage correlates with a significant shift in ownership, potentially based on recent and relevant information. Stocks with an average volume of over 200,000 are included in the list, suggesting much trading activity with strong interest from buyers and sellers. Additionally, we have considered only those stocks with a positive return on equity (ROE). With this criterion, we ensured that our picks generated income for the investments made by the shareholders. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 16, 2025. And we have ranked our picks based on the percentage change in insider ownership. A technician filling bottles with nature-based ingredients for the company's personal care products. Change in Insider Ownership: 6.41% Dividend Yield: 3.37% A specialty materials company, Ashland Inc. (NYSE:ASH) serves markets such as pharmaceuticals, personal care, coatings, and adhesives from its headquarters located in Delaware. The company's portfolio includes excipients, rheology modifiers, and biofunctional ingredients. Customization of these products is carried out about performance and regulatory compliance. Formulation expertise and innovation focusing on sustainability allow the company to compete against market players like DuPont. The company repositioned itself toward high-margin and science-based businesses, increasing its foothold despite consumer demand shifts. Ashland Inc. (NYSE:ASH)'s sales in the first quarter of 2025 went down by 14%, reaching $405 million due to portfolio optimization, including the divestiture of Nutraceutical. On the other hand, the strong demand for skin and hair care resulted in a fourth consecutive quarter of over 25% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the personal care segment. Additionally, the portfolio optimization initiatives, though they have caused a decline in sales in the recent quarter, are expected by the company to improve profitability in the long term. As per the 2025 company guidance, a sale of $1.90 billion to $2.05 billion is anticipated. Ashland Inc. (NYSE:ASH) has high internal optimism, as insider ownership has surged by 6.41% in the last six months. Though it has the lowest dividend yield (3.37%) on our list, the company could be the best addition for investors looking to diversify their portfolio with a dividend-paying stock from the chemicals and specialty ingredients industry. Overall ASH ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the dividend paying stocks insiders are buying. While we acknowledge the potential of ASH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

  "YF_605554_1": "Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently published a list of the 11 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other cheap NASDAQ stocks. On April 10, Dan Ives, Head of Global Tech Research at Wedbush Securities, appeared on an interview at CNBC and expressed that the tech sector could be heading into a period of major volatility. Dan Ives addressed the current landscape for technology companies and pointed out that while a temporary pause in tariffs has provided some structure, the sector remains uncertain in general. He noted that even with this framework, large tech purchases are still being downsized or paused, which contributes to ongoing volatility, especially as companies approach earnings season. Many tech firms are either withholding guidance or providing only general outlooks. Ives described the situation as a storm whose full damage is only beginning to be assessed, with the industry still only a quarter of the way through the fallout. He explained the sharp pullback in major tech stocks by likening it to emerging from a storm and confronting the resulting damage. Ives highlighted that the uncertainty in tech has been amplified by the escalating tariffs on China, which are now as high as 125%, and are a major concern for a lot of companies, as China remains central to the global tech supply chain. Ives also pointed out that the recent tariffs on China have forced companies to reconsider the costs and logistics of importing critical components. For example, a $100,000 part might now cost double due to tariffs, causing companies to halt or delay large investments. This has resulted in a notable pause in tech spending, which he expects to continue at least through the current quarter. He cautioned that the June quarter is likely to be very weak. He maintained that, despite the challenges, he has not downgraded tech stocks, drawing on lessons from the pandemic playbook, where periods of uncertainty eventually led to clear winners and losers. Ives also addressed concerns that tech companies, by pulling back on spending, might risk drawing negative attention from the administration, especially given recent meetings between tech CEOs and the president. He reiterated that China is the epicenter of the current turmoil and that big tech is caught in the middle of a high-stakes situation, with companies still trying to navigate the evolving landscape. Ives predicted that Street estimates are likely to see earnings cuts of about 10% across internet and big tech companies, which reflects the broader pullback in spending and ongoing volatility.

The broad-based market anxiety increased as the US policy uncertainty rose, says Fidelity. The financial markets were weighed down by tariff hikes, deregulation, and tighter immigration policies. The global business cycle is now less synchronized. As per the investment management firm, the US seemed to show mid- and late-cycle dynamics in Q1 2025. Furthermore, the diversification across fixed income and non-US assets is of utmost importance amid growth risks. While the gold and commodities gained, the US dollar decline fueled the non-US equities, says Fidelity. As per Fidelity, the uncertainty regarding the direction of US policy impacted the financial markets during Q1, with investors digesting the news related to executive actions, such as tariff increases, deregulation announcements, reduced government staffing and programs, and tougher immigration activities. Also, the worries related to the economic effects of the tariff increases on the global economy saw an increase during the days after the quarter closed. Despite elevated growth risks, the global expansion was intact as of the close of Q1. Fidelity opines that diversification in fixed income assets and non-US assets is essential. As per the investment manager, the S&P 500 Index delivered a return of \u22124.3% for Q1 2025, partly because of the performance of growth stocks (\u221210%). On the other hand, gold (+19%) and commodities (+8.9%) saw robust gains amid higher market uncertainty.

According to Fidelity, the consumer inflation remained rangebound at ~3% during Q1, which was well above the 2% target of the US Fed. The firm anticipates sticky inflation around 3% for the next year, with upside risk resulting from tariff increases. As per the firm, the consumer inflation expectations have increased to multi-decade highs, making it simpler for businesses to pass the increased costs. Coming to the labor, it has remained tight so far, despite increased policy uncertainty, government layoffs, and federal funding cuts, says Fidelity. On the supply side, the broader labor force participation has stalled below the pre-pandemic rate due to slowing immigration as well as demographic constraints. As per Marci McGregor, Head of Portfolio Strategy (Chief Investment Office), Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, the next few months can be a good time to play defense. The investors can consider defensive, dividend-paying, and value-oriented stocks. For the long term, the investors can position themselves for when the uncertainty around trade decreases. The volatility can provide a chance to buy assets supporting the long-term strategy at attractive prices, says McGregor.

U.S. Bancorp honored longtime executive Terry Dolan during its first earnings call of the year, following his death in a plane crash on March 31, where he was the sole passenger. Remembered for his leadership, warmth, and community contributions, Dolan was celebrated by colleagues and investors for his pivotal role in the bank's growth and his deep commitment to philanthropy. On its first earnings call of the year U.S. Bancorp executives remembered their former colleague Terry Dolan, who died in a plane crash in Minnesota last month. Previously the bank said it believed Dolan had died when the Socata TBM 700 airplane registered in his name crashed into a home near Brooklyn Park on the outskirts of Minneapolis on March 31. On April 1 authorities confirmed Dolan, 63, had been the pilot and sole passenger on board the flight. \"As we collectively mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Terry Dolan, the U.S. Bank family truly appreciates the outpouring of support and heartfelt condolences we\u2019ve received from far and wide. Our prayers continue to be with his family and friends during this most difficult time,\" CEO Gunjan Kedia said in a press release ahead of the earnings call. On the call investors and analysts shared their condolences with the team at U.S. Bank, remembering Dolan's \"big smile and warm embrace.\" \"He\u2019ll be missed by everybody on this call and throughout the investment community,\" added Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Kedia, who had taken over the top job at U.S. Bank days before the earnings update, opened her remarks with thanks to those peers, adding: \"We have truly appreciated the outpouring of support we have received from the investment community since his tragic passing last month and our thoughts remain with his friends and family.\" Per a statement from the FAA, Dolan's plane departed from Des Moines International Airport in Iowa and was bound for Anoka County-Blaine Airport in Minneapolis. The accident occurred at approximately 12.20pm. One person was in the home that the plane crashed into, but the individual was able to escape safely. Dolan was born and bred in Minnesota, where U.S. Bank is based, and was the tenth of 13 children in a busy farming family. Per his obituary in 'The Minnesota Star', Dolan was a keen sportsman who met his wife, Susan Mix, at a golf club, and the pair married in 1982. A year later, Dolan graduated from Minnesota's University of St Thomas with a degree in accounting. He began his career in public accounting before specializing in banking. The Dolan family moved to Ohio but returned to their home state in 1998 courtesy of an offer to join U.S. Bank. At America's fifth-largest bank, Dolan served in a range of roles, including vice chair of wealth management and investment services, executive vice president and controller, chief financial officer and ultimately vice chair and chief administration officer. Dolan is credited with helping lead the bank on its journey of growth and digital transformation, while maintaining its well-reported focus on strong risk management and finances. The executive also let the bank's community development work, including investments in areas such as affordable housing and renewable energy tax credit financing. Dolan's fellow alumni at the University of St Thomas include U.S. Bank's former CEO Andy Cecere, who wrote in a communication to employees before his departure: \u201cTerry was an outstanding businessman, but more importantly, he was a wonderful person. He cared deeply about the people he worked with and the teams he led, and his legacy can be seen everywhere we look. \"I have been reflecting on Terry\u2019s life and the friendship we shared in the few quiet moments we\u2019ve had since this news first reached us. I have known him since college, and it has been a privilege working with him here for more than 25 years.\u201d Dolan was also remembered for his philanthropy. At St Thomas, for example, he established the Dolan Family Endowed Scholarship fund in 2012 to support undergraduate students with academic merit in support of financial need. He also served on the boards of a number of charities and cultural organizations such as the Minnesota Opera. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com Sign in to access your portfolio",

Lithium mining start-up Standard Lithium (NYSEMKT: SLI), which (six months after I last wrote about it) still isn't actually producing any lithium at all, is nonetheless enjoying a banner day on the stock market Tuesday, its shares up 7.8% through 10:10 a.m. ET. And why? Standard Lithium could soon turn into a real lithium company. Where to invest $1,000 right now?\u00a0Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks\u00a0to buy right now.\u00a0Continue \u00bb In an 8-K filing with the SEC this morning (containing a press release apparently issued yesterday), Standard Lithium announced that the South West Arkansas project (SWA) of its Smackover Lithium joint venture with Norwegian energy concern Equinor ASA has been designated a \"priority transparency critical mineral project\" under President Trump's Executive Order 14241 on \"Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production.\" That's quite a mouthful. Here's what it means, though, according to Standard Lithium: \"Support from the White House signals strong federal backing for the project, reinforcing its role in reducing U.S. reliance on China.\" It also makes SWA one of only three domestic lithium projects in the U.S. receiving Department of Energy support. It remains to be seen if this support will be of the financial or merely moral variety, however, and for the time being investors should probably presume the latter. That probably means investors should anticipate significant capital expenditures on Standard Lithium's part as the company continues to develop itself from its start-up phase and move toward actual lithium-producing operations. How long will that take, though? No one seems to know. None of the analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence are willing to even hazard a guess as to when Standard Lithium will begin producing revenue, much less profit -- other than to say that neither revenue nor profit can be expected before 2027. Long story short, today's news is a positive development for Standard Lithium, but not one to bet the ranch on. This start-up remains a speculative stock and should be treated as such. Before you buy stock in Standard Lithium, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Standard Lithium wasn\u2019t one of them.

The broad-based market anxiety increased as the US policy uncertainty rose, says Fidelity. The financial markets were weighed down by tariff hikes, deregulation, and tighter immigration policies. The global business cycle is now less synchronized. As per the investment management firm, the US seemed to show mid- and late-cycle dynamics in Q1 2025. Furthermore, the diversification across fixed income and non-US assets is of utmost importance amid growth risks. While the gold and commodities gained, the US dollar decline fueled the non-US equities, says Fidelity. As per Fidelity, the uncertainty regarding the direction of US policy impacted the financial markets during Q1, with investors digesting the news related to executive actions, such as tariff increases, deregulation announcements, reduced government staffing and programs, and tougher immigration activities. Also, the worries related to the economic effects of the tariff increases on the global economy saw an increase during the days after the quarter closed. Despite elevated growth risks, the global expansion was intact as of the close of Q1. Fidelity opines that diversification in fixed income assets and non-US assets is essential. As per the investment manager, the S&P 500 Index delivered a return of \u22124.3% for Q1 2025, partly because of the performance of growth stocks (\u221210%).

The firm anticipates sticky inflation around 3% for the next year, with upside risk resulting from tariff increases. As per the firm, the consumer inflation expectations have increased to multi-decade highs, making it simpler for businesses to pass the increased costs. Coming to the labor, it has remained tight so far, despite increased policy uncertainty, government layoffs, and federal funding cuts, says Fidelity. On the supply side, the broader labor force participation has stalled below the pre-pandemic rate due to slowing immigration as well as demographic constraints. As per Marci McGregor, Head of Portfolio Strategy (Chief Investment Office), Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, the next few months can be a good time to play defense. The investors can consider defensive, dividend-paying, and value-oriented stocks. For the long term, the investors can position themselves for when the uncertainty around trade decreases. The volatility can provide a chance to buy assets supporting the long-term strategy at attractive prices, says McGregor.

South Korea's domestic cryptocurrency market reached unprecedented valuations in December 2024, with the overall value of crypto assets in local wallets exceeding 100 trillion won. This is approximately $70.5 billion, according to a Bank of Korea (BOK) report cited by Busan Ilbo on April 22. This was the highest monthly total since the central bank began reporting crypto-related data and is approximately 2.2 times larger than last October when crypto assets in local wallets reached 58 trillion won, or $41 billion. According to the report, analysts attribute the quick turnover to the market excitement surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election in November and his public stances supporting crypto and other digital assets. President Trump's public stance on a pro-crypto position, including policy proposals intending to roll back restrictions on digital assets and promote the equivalent of digital assets in future blockchain innovations, has reportedly impacted the flow of money, not only in the U.S. but across the globe, especially in South Korea. The BOK indicated a clear surge in trading activity shortly after the elections. In the last week of December, the average trading volume reached 17.2 trillion won, which is approximately $12.1 billion\u2014nearly five times larger than the average trading volume of October.

As per the analyst, the market is not fully appreciating Verizon Communications Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:VZ)\u2019s resilient wireless service revenue growth outlook, efforts related to the fiber expansion, and the potential strategic and financial benefits due to the Frontier acquisition. Overall, the analyst believes that wireless companies can continue to perform well, considering the current market uncertainty and downside risks.

The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka \u201cwireless cable\u201d) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing\u2019s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper\u2019s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.\u201d Overall, VZ ranks 8th on our list of cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Paying Stocks Insiders Are Buying.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM) stands against the other dividend paying stocks. Uncertainty is not among the market's favorites. Yet, at present, uncertainty is prevailing throughout the market. The U.S.-China trade escalation and the new tariffs on all other U.S. trading partners have left investors scrambling to find stable ground. READ ALSO: 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Just this week, CNBC reported President Trump's announcement to charge steep fees on ships built in China, presently docking at the U.S. ports, a move the analysts perceive could cause the shipping costs to go high and send a ripple through consumer prices. China, the significant retaliator to Trump's tariffs, has started targeting the U.S. service sector by threatening everything from tourism to tech talent pipelines. Even the blue-chip stocks find the current climate unfavorable, thus increasing the adoption rate of another strategy: dividend-paying stocks. And here's the kicker \u2013 insiders are loading up on them. Dividends are the financial shock absorbers when growth stocks swing wildly on trade war headlines. Investors in such an unfavorable market condition often prioritize the cash flow today rather than the promises of growth tomorrow. Historically, in many instances, when the market is experiencing turbulence, the dividend-paying stocks outperformed their non-dividend peers. In addition to padding the portfolio, the dividend stocks have signaled corporate resilience. And right now, insiders like executives and board members are betting big on the stability of the dividend stocks. Corporate leaders buy shares of their companies to add credibility to the stocks. At the same time, it also indicates that they see an undervalued potential in their stocks. Unlike analysts, the insiders have first-hand information regarding earnings forecasts, balance sheets, and the company's strategies that would allow it to weather the upcoming storms. The recent U.S.-China tariff escalations stand as a prime example of such storms. The headlines focus on the two countries' shipping fees and rare-earth export controls. Meanwhile, board members of some companies are scooping up stocks. But these are not speculative plays; they are calculated decisions made using the unique knowledge of the company's cash flows, debt, and history of raising dividends. Now, let us zoom out. The market position is clear. According to CNBC, volatility has become the new normal with China's retaliation squeezing the services trade sector, where the U.S. holds a $32 billion surplus. Finding an appropriate dividend that could add some resilience to the portfolio becomes a necessity. Using insider backing to find the best stock offers a rare blend of defensive positioning and growth potential. In this regard, we have done the legwork to uncover 10 dividend-paying stocks with high insider confidence. In addition to offering a positive yield, our picks could fortify your investments against the market chaos caused by the trade war. You may be hedging against inflation, chasing reliable income, or simply copying the moves of those in the know. When putting together our top 10 picks for the best dividend-paying stocks investors are buying, we followed a few criteria. We set the dividend yield at a minimum of 3%. This criterion is in place to provide investors with optimal income-generating stocks. We did not include stocks with an insider ownership change of less than 4% in the last six months since a larger percentage correlates with a significant shift in ownership, potentially based on recent and relevant information. Stocks with an average volume of over 200,000 are included in the list, suggesting much trading activity with strong interest from buyers and sellers. Additionally, we have considered only those stocks with a positive return on equity (ROE). With this criterion, we ensured that our picks generated income for the investments made by the shareholders. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 16, 2025. And we have ranked our picks based on the percentage change in insider ownership. A businessperson examining financial graphs and charts of the company's portfolio, while surrounded by residential mortgage loan documents. Change in Insider Ownership: 8.14% Dividend Yield: 12.99% Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) based in New York. The focus is on mortgage assets, including agency- and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, mortgage loans, and other credit-sensitive investments. The company utilizes a hybrid strategy, balancing yield and risk through active portfolio management to gain a strong foothold amidst heavy competition. In addition to credit performance, the company prioritizes asset diversification and interest rate hedging to survive volatile fixed-income markets. Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM) reported a GAAP net loss of $168.3 million in the Q4 of 2024. However, the quarterly dividend increased by 12%, indicating confidence in the company's financial health and a strong commitment to shareholders. The acquisition of the Palisades Group is expected to assist Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM) in diversifying its revenue stream by offering a new fee-based source of income that would elevate its earnings. Completing significant share repurchases and maintaining consistency in dividend payments has also earned the company confidence among shareholders and insiders. The company's plans for the year include diversifying the portfolio and increasing liquidity to stabilize its dividends amid the market volatility. Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM) insiders expressed their growing confidence in the company through an 8.14% increase in holdings. The firm offers a sizable dividend yield of 12.99% and gains the top spot in the list of best dividend stocks for income-focused portfolios. Overall CIM ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the dividend paying stocks insiders are buying.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:CVX) stands against other cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The broad-based market anxiety increased as the US policy uncertainty rose, says Fidelity. The financial markets were weighed down by tariff hikes, deregulation, and tighter immigration policies. The global business cycle is now less synchronized. As per the investment management firm, the US seemed to show mid- and late-cycle dynamics in Q1 2025. Furthermore, the diversification across fixed income and non-US assets is of utmost importance amid growth risks. While the gold and commodities gained, the US dollar decline fueled the non-US equities, says Fidelity. As per Fidelity, the uncertainty regarding the direction of US policy impacted the financial markets during Q1, with investors digesting the news related to executive actions, such as tariff increases, deregulation announcements, reduced government staffing and programs, and tougher immigration activities. Also, the worries related to the economic effects of the tariff increases on the global economy saw an increase during the days after the quarter closed. Despite elevated growth risks, the global expansion was intact as of the close of Q1. Fidelity opines that diversification in fixed income assets and non-US assets is essential. As per the investment manager, the S&P 500 Index delivered a return of \u22124.3% for Q1 2025, partly because of the performance of growth stocks (\u221210%). On the other hand, gold (+19%) and commodities (+8.9%) saw robust gains amid higher market uncertainty.

According to Fidelity, the consumer inflation remained rangebound at ~3% during Q1, which was well above the 2% target of the US Fed. The firm anticipates sticky inflation around 3% for the next year, with upside risk resulting from tariff increases. As per the firm, the consumer inflation expectations have increased to multi-decade highs, making it simpler for businesses to pass the increased costs. Coming to the labor, it has remained tight so far, despite increased policy uncertainty, government layoffs, and federal funding cuts, says Fidelity. On the supply side, the broader labor force participation has stalled below the pre-pandemic rate due to slowing immigration as well as demographic constraints. As per Marci McGregor, Head of Portfolio Strategy (Chief Investment Office), Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, the next few months can be a good time to play defense. The investors can consider defensive, dividend-paying, and value-oriented stocks. For the long term, the investors can position themselves for when the uncertainty around trade decreases. The volatility can provide a chance to buy assets supporting the long-term strategy at attractive prices, says McGregor.

The analyst\u2019s rating is being supported by the company\u2019s strategic moves, which include the purchase of Hess shares, demonstrating confidence in future growth. Notably, between January and March 2025, Chevron Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:CVX) purchased 15,380,000 shares of Hess Corporation common stock, implying ~4.99% of the shares of Hess common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2025. Amidst the macroeconomic uncertainties, including tariff\u00a0disputes and volatile oil prices, Chevron Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:CVX)\u2019s stable cash flow and capital allocation strategies offer a robust foundation for continued investment, says Read. As per Morningstar, Chevron Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:CVX) is well-placed to deliver increased returns and greater FCF due to its oil-leveraged portfolio\u2019s volume growth and margin expansion, improved operations, and cost reductions. The company has started oil and natural gas production from the Ballymore subsea tieback in the deepwater Gulf of America. Ballymore exhibits another step towards Chevron Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:CVX)\u2019s goal to produce 300,000 net barrels per day of oil equivalent from the Gulf in 2026.\u00a0Ballymore brings additional production online without building a new standalone offshore platform. This reduces the development costs and can fuel increased returns for shareholders. Overall, CVX ranks 6th on our list of cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

As per the analyst, the healthy dynamics in the wireless market can exceed Street estimates, thanks to the robust subscriber growth and higher pricing.

At initiation, the stock had a $141 billion market capitalization and met all five valuation factors with an above market dividend yield of 5.6%. From a sustainability prism, the company completed its commitment to invest $2 billion by the end of 2023 to help bridge the digital divide. AT&T is working on enabling low-income households to access to low-cost broadband services through its Access service plan as well as reaching out to more rural communities and Tribal lands where internet access remains a challenge. It is nearly 85% the way to providing one million people in need with digital resources through AT&T Connected Learning\u00ae with the goal to be reached by the end of 2025. In 2020, the company announced that it is committed to be carbon neutral by 2035 with zero carbon emission across all operations. It is deploying Smart Climate Solutions \u2013 through efforts like its Connected Climate Initiative \u2013 that will help enable its business customers to reduce their emissions as well. The company\u2019s goal is to help collectively reduce its emissions by one billion metric tons \u2013 a gigaton \u2013 by 2035, compared to 2018 levels. The primary catalysts are new/strong management and restructuring. John Stankey was appointed CEO in July 2020 and he is committed to refocusing the company and improving its financial performance. The company combined its WarnerMedia operation with Discovery during 1Q:22 which eliminated AT&T\u2019s exposure to the rapidly evolving media industry and refocused its core telecommunication business thus eliminating a major drag on profitability and the company\u2019s balance sheet by reducing long-term debt from a peak $176 billion during 2020 to $142 billion at the end of June 2024 quarter. AT&T is moving aggressively to reduce cost and sell non-core assets such as its advertising platform Xander to Microsoft\u2020 which was accomplished during 2022. The company has redesigned its network to be software driven structure reducing the capital investment cycle in its national network \u2013 resulting in a network that is flexible with unrivaled speed and reliability \u2013 thus enhancing its nationwide position. By the end of 2023, it expanded its 5G network to reach more than 302 million people in nearly 24,500 cities and towns in the U.S. The company\u2019s mid-band 5G+ network alone grew to cover more than 210 million people. AT&T is one of the largest investors in digital infrastructure in the U.S. Over the five years ending 2023, the company invested nearly $150 billion primarily in its wireless, fiber optics, and wireline networks. The extensive restructuring and refocusing of AT&T on its core business should result in improved earnings and cash flow while at the same time reducing uncertainty for shareholders.\u201d Overall, T ranks 7th on our list of cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

  "YF_937120_1": "Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently published a list of 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against other cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The broad-based market anxiety increased as the US policy uncertainty rose, says Fidelity. The financial markets were weighed down by tariff hikes, deregulation, and tighter immigration policies. The global business cycle is now less synchronized. As per the investment management firm, the US seemed to show mid- and late-cycle dynamics in Q1 2025. Furthermore, the diversification across fixed income and non-US assets is of utmost importance amid growth risks. While the gold and commodities gained, the US dollar decline fueled the non-US equities, says Fidelity. As per Fidelity, the uncertainty regarding the direction of US policy impacted the financial markets during Q1, with investors digesting the news related to executive actions, such as tariff increases, deregulation announcements, reduced government staffing and programs, and tougher immigration activities. Also, the worries related to the economic effects of the tariff increases on the global economy saw an increase during the days after the quarter closed. Despite elevated growth risks, the global expansion was intact as of the close of Q1. Fidelity opines that diversification in fixed income assets and non-US assets is essential. As per the investment manager, the S&P 500 Index delivered a return of \u22124.3% for Q1 2025, partly because of the performance of growth stocks (\u221210%). On the other hand, gold (+19%) and commodities (+8.9%) saw robust gains amid higher market uncertainty.

According to Fidelity, the consumer inflation remained rangebound at ~3% during Q1, which was well above the 2% target of the US Fed. The firm anticipates sticky inflation around 3% for the next year, with upside risk resulting from tariff increases. As per the firm, the consumer inflation expectations have increased to multi-decade highs, making it simpler for businesses to pass the increased costs. Coming to the labor, it has remained tight so far, despite increased policy uncertainty, government layoffs, and federal funding cuts, says Fidelity. On the supply side, the broader labor force participation has stalled below the pre-pandemic rate due to slowing immigration as well as demographic constraints. As per Marci McGregor, Head of Portfolio Strategy (Chief Investment Office), Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, the next few months can be a good time to play defense. The investors can consider defensive, dividend-paying, and value-oriented stocks. For the long term, the investors can position themselves for when the uncertainty around trade decreases. The volatility can provide a chance to buy assets supporting the long-term strategy at attractive prices, says McGregor. To list the 10 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we scanned the holdings of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and chose companies that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q4 2024. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here). A packed theater of moviegoers watching a blockbuster film produced by the entertainment company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Forward P/E as of April 18: ~15.4x The Walt Disney Company\u00a0(NYSE:DIS) operates as an entertainment company. Wolf Research upped the company\u2019s stock to \u2018Outperform\u2019 from \u2018Peer Perform,\u2019 highlighting durable strengths in its core businesses even during broader worries related to recession. The firm lauded The Walt Disney Company\u00a0(NYSE:DIS)\u2019s long-term advantages throughout its theme parks, cruise lines, and streaming operations. Analyst Peter Supino of\u00a0Wolfe Research opines that, in the entertainment business, the company can gain from the measures to restrict the practice of password sharing. Furthermore, the analyst expects tailwinds from linear TV\u2019s decline and streaming bundles. The analyst opines that The Walt Disney Company\u00a0(NYSE:DIS)\u2019s experiences business can benefit from launches of new cruise ships as well as updates to its theme parks. The company\u2019s diverse content portfolio, consisting of strong franchises, offers a robust foundation for fueling streaming subscriber growth. Several of The Walt Disney Company\u00a0(NYSE:DIS)\u2019s franchises have global popularity, aiding international expansion of the streaming services. Therefore, by effectively using its content portfolio throughout the streaming platforms, The Walt Disney Company\u00a0(NYSE:DIS) possesses the potential to grow its subscriber base, drive engagement, and reduce churn. ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its Q1 2025 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said: \u201cWhile we had already begun to shift toward a more defensive positioning entering the quarter, we made a number of adjustments in response to the rapid-fire developments in both economic and political policy. Among our largest new positions during the period was\u00a0The Walt Disney Company\u00a0(NYSE:DIS), as we believe that it has turned a corner on building out its streaming service, which should help margins inflect higher and help drive better earnings than the market currently anticipates. The shift in management\u2019s strategy, from \u201cmarket share growth at all costs\u201d to a more focused approach on improving pricing should also help to improve both profitability and margins, and we believe that there remains meaningful upside compared to other streaming service providers at similar scale.\u201d Overall, DIS ranks 2nd on our list of cheap blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than DIS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Stock options are showing the potential for big moves after earnings. Options help traders predict how a stock will move following any event, including earnings. However, the math can be a little arcane. To put it simply: Traders trading options want to make money. Looking at what those traders are paying for call and put options close to the date of an event can offer clues as to how traders expect a stock will trade after an event.
