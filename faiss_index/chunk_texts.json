  "2025-04-26_267940_1": "\u201cMad Max\u201d gets a prequel, \u201cThe Wiz\u201d returns to Broadway and Larry David gets another crack at a series finale. Holland Cotter Early in 1969, the Metropolitan Museum sparked an uproar with an exhibition called \u201cHarlem on My Mind: Cultural Capital of Black America, 1900-1968.\u201d Although conceived as the museum\u2019s first big-ticket acknowledgment of African American creativity, it included no visual art beyond documentary photomurals. Black artists, many working in Harlem just blocks north of the museum, angrily picketed the show, denouncing it as evidence of art world racism writ large. As a student visiting New York in 1969 I saw, and was baffled by, that show, so I\u2019m eager to see a new one that can only be viewed as a corrective to it, the marquee-scale survey of paintings, sculptures, photographs and films titled \u201cThe Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism\u201d scheduled to open at the Met in February. The announced inclusion of a wealth of African American art considered inadmissible to the Met half a century ago \u2014 some represented by rarely seen loans from the collections of some of the country\u2019s historically Black colleges and universities \u2014 is, on its own, an exciting prospect. And so is the exhibition\u2019s larger promise to fully position modern African American art not just as a local phenomenon, but as a generator of international modernism itself. Alissa Wilkinson This year brings a lot of sequels: \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cBeetlejuice 2,\u201d \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d \u201cGladiator 2,\u201d \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d plus new films in the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d and \u201cVenom\u201d and \u201cPaddington\u201d and \u201cGodzilla\u201d and even \u201cDespicable Me\u201d cinematic universes. I rarely get excited for non-original films, since most of them come off as naked cash grabs capitalizing on existing I.P. and risk-averse audiences. But I\u2019m always curious if a sequel (or prequel or side-quel or whatever) will manage to be good, and the one I\u2019m excited for is \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga.\u201d George Miller returns to direct an origin story for the character that Charlize Theron played in 2015\u2019s \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d with Anya Taylor-Joy in the Furiosa role. I love a dystopia, and few have exceeded the sheer adrenaline and dread of \u201cFury Road.\u201d I\u2019m revisiting all the \u201cMad Max\u201d movies in preparation. Mike Hale Clive Owen as an aging Sam Spade on AMC\u2019s \u201cMonsieur Spade\u201d (Jan. 14), Helena Bonham Carter as the 1970s soap opera star Noele Gordon (\u201cNolly,\u201d PBS), Ben Mendelsohn and Juliette Binoche as Christian Dior and Coco Chanel (\u201cThe New Look,\u201d Apple TV+, Feb. 14) \u2014 there may have never been a new TV year with so many intriguing bits of casting. But the one that has me the most curious is the wonderfully acidic British actor Tom Hollander playing Truman Capote in FX\u2019s \u201cFeud: Capote vs. the Swans\u201d (Jan. 31). Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Calista Flockhart play some of the society women Capote befriended and then used as material for his highly unflattering roman \u00e0 clef \u201cAnswered Prayers\u201d; if the thought of Hollander channeling Capote as he calls Happy Rockefeller \u201cthat fat-ankled harridan\u201d turns you on, then you must tune in.

  "2025-04-26_242826_1": "Middle East Tensions New Year\u2019s celebrations took place as protesters against the Israel-Hamas war staged demonstrations in Midtown Manhattan. Hundreds of thousands of people crowded into Times Square on Sunday night to ring in the New Year, amid heightened security and scattered demonstrations in Midtown Manhattan over the Israel-Hamas war. The police presence was heavier than usual for New Year\u2019s Eve, with thousands of officers deployed and canine units and officers on horseback monitoring an expanded security zone. Officers scanned every entering reveler with a metal detecting wand. But the crowd, who took in performances by Megan Thee Stallion, Flo Rida and Tyla, did not seem to mind. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have to do once in my life,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Blouin, who took a bus to New York from Quebec City with his sister. After watching the ball descend, he panned his phone across Times Square to capture the multicolor confetti that rained down from the heavens. Emmanuel Gonzalez, 29, who came by himself from Mexico City, said he had watched the festivities on TV for years and wanted \u201cto live the experience.\u201d Across town at Grand Central Terminal, a small flash-mob of about 30 protesters unfurled Palestinian flags as midnight struck, tossing balloons the colors of the flag \u2014 red, green, black and white \u2014 and chanting, \u201cCease-fire now!\u201d As midnight approached around the world, night skies filled with lights and fireworks, from Bangkok to Cape Town, Berlin to Buenos Aires.

  "2025-04-26_127145_1": "The tentative deal for the men\u2019s golf circuits to join forces had a Dec. 31 deadline, but significant questions remained. When the PGA Tour and the upstart LIV Golf league, which is bankrolled by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, announced their groundbreaking deal in June for the men\u2019s golf circuits to join forces, they left most details unanswered and set a Dec. 31 deadline to figure them out. Now, it is clear that the two sides will need more time. The PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, said in a memo to players Sunday evening that the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, were \u201cworking to extend\u201d the negotiations into the new year. The sides had been discussing signing a formal one-month extension, which could be further prolonged, said three people familiar with the negotiations who were not authorized to discuss them. But while both sides remain focused on completing a deal, they have yet to set any new formal deadline. Those negotiations continue as the PGA Tour progresses on simultaneous talks to raise additional money from Strategic Sports Group, an investment group led by Fenway Sports Group \u2014 the parent company of the Boston Red Sox, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the English soccer club Liverpool. Mr. Monahan said on Sunday that the tour and Strategic Sports Group \u201chave made meaningful progress\u201d in their talks and that the tour had \u201cprovided S.S.G. with the due diligence information they requested.\u201d The parties are focused on finalizing terms of the deal and documents, he said. The PGA Tour, the Saudi wealth fund and the Strategic Sports Group enter 2024 with significant uncertainty about the deal. Since the June announcement, questions that had initially accompanied the agreement\u2019s frenzied rollout appear to have compounded: How will potential U.S. investment sit alongside Saudi money? How will the golf circuits work together even as the Saudis still actively seek to poach PGA Tour players? Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_549034_1": "Middle East Tensions Iranian-backed Houthi gunmen from Yemen had fired on American helicopters responding to an attack on a commercial ship, American officials said. A clash between Iranian-backed Houthi fighters who were attacking a commercial freighter and U.S. Navy helicopters responding to the ship\u2019s distress call ended on Sunday morning with the killing of all the crew members on three Houthi boats, the Pentagon said, a sharp escalation of violence at a moment when the White House is considering direct strikes on Iran\u2019s proxies in the Middle East. It appeared to be the first time that American and allied forces patrolling the Red Sea, a critical waterway for oil and other shipments, have engaged in a deadly firefight with the Houthis since their attacks on ships began in October, following the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas. President Biden has said he wants to avoid direct military attacks on the Houthis in Yemen, to avoid escalating a Middle East conflict that is already threatening to spread throughout the region. But in the fight that broke out on Sunday morning, the Navy forces had little choice, at least according to the account given by United States Central Command. The Houthis had launched an attack on the freighter, the Maersk Hangzhou, a Singapore-flagged container ship, and were attempting to board it. As the ship\u2019s security forces tried to hold the attackers at bay, helicopters from the U.S.S. Eisenhower carrier group arrived to chase them away and the Houthis opened fire on them. \u201cThe small boats fired upon the U.S. helicopters with crew-served weapons and small arms,\u201d Central Command said in a statement. \u201cThe U.S. Navy helicopters returned fire in self-defense, sinking three of the four small boats, and killing the crews.\u201d Central Command did not say how many had been killed, but in a statement later on Sunday the Houthis said that 10 of their fighters were dead. \u201cThe American enemy bears the consequences of this crime,\u2019\u2019 they said in a statement, and \u201cits military movements in the Red Sea to protect Israeli ships won\u2019t prevent\u201d the Houthis from \u201cperforming their religious, moral and humanitarian duty in support and aid of those who have been wronged in Palestine and Gaza.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_110190_1": "wordplay, the crossword column Harry Zheng makes his New York Times debut. Jump to: Today\u2019s Theme | Tricky Clues MONDAY PUZZLE \u2014 That I have been entrusted with the task of writing about the first New York Times puzzle of 2024 feels like a kind of oversight. Me, having the first word on crosswords for the year ahead? And there wasn\u2019t a more famous person who had to drop out because of a scheduling conflict? Many of us feel similarly cowed when staring down a new set of numbers at the top of our datebooks. There\u2019s just something about the invitation to \u201cTurn over a new leaf, say\u201d (10D) with a fresh year that makes everything matter too much. For advice on how to brave the scale of the occasion, we might look to Harry Zheng, the constructor of today\u2019s puzzle. This is his New York Times debut, and it happens to be published on the first day of a new calendar year. What should that mean? With a buoyant, guileless grid and a cheerful theme, Mr. Zheng reminds us not to take ourselves \u2014 or this day \u2014 too seriously. It\u2019s just the beginning of another year of solving crosswords. And isn\u2019t that glorious? Mr. Zheng\u2019s theme merely requires the detection of a pattern among the entries at 20-, 27-, 43- and 51-Across. I\u2019d deem the simplest of these entries to be DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE, the \u201cKid\u2019s chasing game with head taps\u201d (20A). The other entries aren\u2019t as obvious \u2014 but once you\u2019ve gotten the \u201cOff Broadway musical made into a 2021 film directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda\u201d (27A), then TICK, TICK, BOOM! Everything is blasted wide open, since it\u2019s easy to see what these entries have in common: the repetition of the first word. So it goes at 43-Across, with a \u201cReply to \u2018Three cheers!\u2019\u201d \u2014 HIP, HIP, HOORAY! \u2014 and at 51-Across, with the \u201cSoothing words\u201d THERE, THERE, NOW. Doleful or delighted: There\u2019s something in it for everyone. If you were hellbent on extracting a New Year\u2019s-related message from Mr. Zheng\u2019s theme, you could read the above entries as a nod to how the year 2024 is read aloud, with the repeated word in \u201ctwenty twenty-four.\u201d But this \u2014 much like resolving to go to the gym every day this year \u2014 seems like a reach. 1A. When we \u201cTake on\u201d debt, we INCUR it. Why don\u2019t we ever INCUR good things, you might ask? (I ask.) The term\u2019s Latin roots suggest an attack, which is probably why we now understand that it means bringing about an undesirable consequence. 10D. To \u201cTurn over a new leaf, say,\u201d is to REFORM, in the sense of changing one\u2019s behavior for the better. When I first solved this entry, I thought it referred in some way to a caterpillar\u2019s re-forming into a butterfly, vis-\u00e0-vis the leaf imagery. I think the brain waves doth protest too much. 13D. ESTES Park, Colo., is a mountain town near Rocky Mountain National Park. It is known in part for the Stanley Hotel, which is rumored to be haunted and inspired the fictional Overlook Hotel in Stephen King\u2019s \u201cThe Shining.\u201d 37D. A \u201cRelative of \u2018Roger,\u2019 in radio transmissions\u201d is COPY THAT. Both phrases signify a recipient\u2019s understanding of a message; there\u2019s even a blended version in \u201cRoger that.\u201d 43D. The \u201cCharge of religious unorthodoxy\u201d is known as HERESY. But if that charge turns out to be baseless? Then it\u2019s just hearsay. 46D. I\u2019ve always found it odd that a \u201cBarber\u2019s razor sharpener\u201d is called a STROP, as opposed to a strap \u2014 and today, even more so, after discovering that the differentiation between the terms is arbitrary. I hope everyone is having a wonderful New Year\u2019s Day.I decided on the first three theme entries pretty easily, but we needed a few revisions and a redesign of the grid before fitting in THERE, THERE, NOW as the last one. Big thanks to the editing team for helping out with that. It\u2019s exciting to have my debut now, when I\u2019ve been constructing for only about half a year. It\u2019s also nice that it\u2019s before my 20th birthday; there could always be more younger people in the field of crossword construction.Happy New Year, and happy solving.

Walaa Zaiter\u2019s four children have been hungry for weeks, but she can barely find them food. They ask for sandwiches, fruit juice and homemade Palestinian dishes like she used to cook before the war began. In a fleeting moment of internet access, she said, she once caught the children huddled around her phone to watch a YouTube video of someone eating French fries. The most they can hope for these days, she said in a recent telephone interview, is a can of peas, some cheese and an energy bar distributed as a family\u2019s rations by the United Nations once a week in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where they fled to in early December to escape Israeli bombardment farther north.

Carrying offerings to the sea on Friday in Rio de Janeiro as part of an annual rite by devotees of Afro-Brazilian religions.Credit... Photographs by Dado Galdieri Reporting from Rio de Janeiro Each New Year\u2019s Eve, more than two million revelers \u2014 twice as many as typically fill Times Square \u2014 dress in white and pack Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro to watch a 15-minute midnight fireworks extravaganza. The one-night hedonistic release is one of the world\u2019s largest New Year\u2019s celebrations and leaves Copacabana\u2019s famed 2.4 miles of sand strewed with trash. But it began as something far more spiritual. In the 1950s, followers of an Afro-Brazilian religion, Umbanda, began congregating on Copacabana on New Year\u2019s Eve to make offerings to their goddess of the sea, Iemanj\u00e1, and ask for good fortune in the year ahead. It quickly became one of the holiest moments of the year for followers of a cluster of Afro-Brazilian religions that have roots in slavery, worship an array of deities and have long faced prejudice in Brazil. Then, in 1987, a hotel along the Copacabana strip started a Dec. 31 fireworks show. It was a huge hit that began attracting large numbers. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

  "2025-04-26_735265_1": "Legislation touching on nearly every aspect of life in the state, including wages, health care and education, is going into effect in the coming months. Gov. Kathy Hochul signed roughly 900 bills in 2023. Those laws \u2014 many of which are scheduled to take effect in the new year \u2014 touch nearly every aspect of New Yorkers\u2019 lives. There are measures recognizing additional school holidays (the Lunar New Year and Diwali), and others that establish broader protections for freelance workers and create new requirements for licensed cosmetologists. What else will change in 2024? Here\u2019s a look at some of the most consequential laws taking effect this year. New York\u2019s minimum wage will rise to $16 per hour in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County and to $15 an hour everywhere else in the state. Both rates will increase by an additional 50 cents in 2025 and 2026, with future increases statewide pegged to inflation. The decision to add $2 to the city\u2019s $15 minimum wage by 2026 \u2014 a plan included in last year\u2019s state budget agreement \u2014 was not universally supported. Some Republican lawmakers warned the move could lead to job losses, while progressive Democrats pushed for a rate of over $21. The state\u2019s wage will remain more than twice that of the increasingly meaningless federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. A new law taking effect this summer will require Medicaid to cover doula services for New Yorkers. It also mandates that the state\u2019s Department of Health create and maintain a directory of doulas. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

  "2025-04-26_409769_1": "the 6-day energy challenge Today\u2019s challenge involves a little daytime rest. To kick off our 6-Day Energy Challenge, we\u2019re focusing on daytime rest. When you think about increasing your energy, getting better sleep probably comes to mind. A night of quality slumber \u2014 at least seven hours for adults \u2014 is critical for cognition and alertness. But many of us struggle to get enough, or we wake up less than refreshed. Daytime rest, however, is a little easier to pull off. Research suggests that taking short, revitalizing breaks can help you fortify yourself throughout the day. These breaks aren\u2019t naps, but they offer similar benefits, restoring attention, reducing fatigue and increasing vitality, and improving well-being and mood. Prioritizing these moments is a form of preventive care, said Dr. Sue Varma, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine and author of the upcoming book \u201cPractical Optimism.\u201d People tend to think of daytime rest as \u201ca reward permissible only when you \u2018deserve\u2019 it,\u201d she said. But it should be a daily health practice, just like exercising or eating well. Today, you\u2019ll take what Dr. Varma calls an \u201coasis moment,\u201d a small respite from the literal and figurative noise around you. \u200b\u200b First, figure out when you can take a five-minute break \u2014 long enough for you to feel refreshed, she said, but brief enough that you can actually fit it in. Dr. Varma recommends doing it before your energy levels dip. It might seem counterintuitive, but research suggests that rest can be more effective at restoring your energy when it\u2019s taken before you are tired, as opposed to after. For people who keep a regular daytime schedule, midmorning is the best time, said Cindy Wu, a professor at Baylor University\u2019s Hankamer School of Business who studies workplace breaks. At that point, she said, \u201cyou\u2019ve only depleted a little bit of the resources, so it\u2019s easier to get them back.\u201d That said, if your morning is booked (or if you work nights and sleep during the day), taking an oasis moment at any time has benefits, Dr. Varma said. Mute your phone or leave it in another room. If you\u2019re home, find a quiet place that\u2019s comfortable for sitting, Dr. Varma said. If you\u2019re at work, scout out a relatively peaceful location \u2014 a seat in the cafeteria or break room, a bench outside, or even your car if you drive to work. The setting is less important than your intention to take a few minutes for yourself, she added. In fact, you don\u2019t need to sit, or even be quiet. Dr. Wu\u2019s findings suggest that it doesn\u2019t matter what you do on your break \u2014 it could be a five-minute walk or a quick coffee \u2014 as long as it\u2019s time spent away from work doing something you enjoy. \u201cWe found that the key characteristic to make that break replenishing was that choice, that autonomy,\u201d Dr. Wu said. Take some slow, deep breaths. Doing this for five minutes can help you feel less depleted. This should not be confused with meditation, Dr. Varma said. An oasis moment isn\u2019t rigid. Aim for a state of what she calls \u201cwakeful relaxation\u201d \u2014 you should feel calmer but still alert. Try to quiet your mind, but don\u2019t strive to zone out. You can even listen to your favorite songs while you take your break. Afterward, notice how you feel: Are you a little more refreshed? Taking this break, Dr. Varma added, might also give you a sense of mastery and control. \u201cYou\u2019ve made space and time for something that\u2019s beneficial,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you feel like you\u2019ve achieved something for the day, similar to making your bed.\u201d Rest is a \u201chighly therapeutic, untapped resource,\u201d and the positive effects can build over time, Dr. Varma said. If you enjoyed this exercise, consider scheduling a five-minute break every day this week, and in the weeks and months following, to keep the rewards coming. Below you\u2019ll find a guided daytime rest exercise from Octavia Faith Ann Raheem, a meditation teacher who conducts rest retreats.

  "2025-04-26_233445_1": "Newsletter Friction between the U.S. and Israel.  No other episode in the past half-century has tested the ties between the U.S. and Israel so significantly as the current war in Gaza. President Biden\u2019s initial resolve to stand by Israel has given way to frustrating phone calls, sharp public comments and exhausting marathon meetings as the relationship has grown fraught. Time and again, Biden and his team have intervened to steer Israel away from what they consider the excesses of its retaliation for Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack \u2014 only to have the Israelis defy them at critical moments. Among Democrats, resistance to Biden\u2019s backing of Israel is growing, and the U.S. has found itself at odds with other countries at the U.N. The friction appears to be coming to a head as the new year arrives and as the death toll in Gaza mounts, though there is no serious discussion inside the administration of a meaningful change in policy, like cutting off the arms supply to Israel. Conversations between Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are increasingly strained. What\u2019s next: The sharpest dispute between Washington and Jerusalem has centered on what to do in Gaza after the war ends. Netanyahu has resisted suggestions that a \u201crevitalized\u201d Palestinian Authority, which is based in the West Bank, run a post-Hamas Gaza, to be followed eventually by the establishment of a Palestinian state. Analysis: Within Israel, there is nearly universal support for the toughest action against Hamas and little concern about possible consequences. In other news from the war: Despite his plummeting popularity, Netanyahu has made clear he has no intention of resigning after the war ends. Defying U.S. pressure, Israeli forces deepened their engagement in Gaza. Some 165 people were killed in a 24-hour period, Palestinian health officials said on Saturday. American helicopters sank three Houthi boats in the Red Sea after coming under fire, killing all the crew members, the Pentagon said. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Jan. 1-7. Details and times are subject to change. 2023 ROCK & ROLL HALL OF FAME INDUCTION CEREMONY 8 p.m. on ABC. Though celebrating music highlights of 2023 on the first day of 2024 feels a little belated, for Missy Elliott and Sheryl Crow I\u2019ll let it go. This ceremony, which took place in Brooklyn in November, includes performances by Elliott and Crow, inductees that year, as well as appearances by Stevie Nicks, Elton John and LL Cool J. MONKEY BUSINESS (1931) 8 p.m. on TCM. The title of this movie aptly portrays the shenanigans that go on when the Marx Brothers stow away on an ocean liner, stirring up drama and laughs while they avoid the wrath of the captain and his crew. FINDING YOUR ROOTS 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This show has told us that Bernie Sanders and Larry David are in fact related, the best-friend duo Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are 10th cousins (once removed) and Kevin Bacon shares relatives with his wife, Kyra Sedgwick. Now it\u2019s back for its 10th season, hosted, as always, by Henry Louis Gates Jr. The first episode will feature the singers Ciara and Alanis Morissette. I CAN SEE YOUR VOICE 8 p.m. on Fox. \u201cThe Voice\u201d allows judges to hear contestants\u2019 singing before laying eyes on them. This competition show does the opposite. Judges on the show, hosted by Ken Jeong, have to rate contestants based on lip-sync challenges and facts about them.

Sarah Bahr\u2019s favorite way to recharge is by seeing a matinee performance of a Broadway musical before an evening editing shift. When around a dozen reporters and editors on The New York Times\u2019s Well desk sat around a long table in a conference room in July to brainstorm ideas for a challenge readers could complete to jump-start their 2024, a variety of suggestions were thrown out: How to live a more joyful life. A week\u2019s worth of decluttering exercises. A relationship challenge. But when Jancee Dunn, who writes The Times\u2019s Well newsletter, asked \u201cWho here is tired?\u201d they knew they had a hit. \u201cEveryone raised their hands,\u201d said Ms. Dunn, who put together a 6-Day Energy Challenge designed to help readers feel more awake throughout the day. The challenge, which is the third Ms. Dunn has designed for The Times, will arrive in the inboxes of subscribers to the Well newsletter each morning beginning today. For five consecutive days, readers will receive energy-boosting tips, prompts and exercises recommended by nutritionists, therapists, doctors and exercise scientists. (Day 6 is a recap.) The challenge offers ways to instantly boost energy, but also sets up readers to stay recharged all year. \u201cI wanted something that would be easy for the reader to do in a couple of minutes that would still produce results,\u201d Ms. Dunn said of the activities, which explore areas like movement, nutrition, relationships and sleep.

  "2025-04-26_773696_1": "Many state laws take effect on the first day of 2024, including new rules on gun safety, a ban on diversity programs and a curb on telemarketing calls. A spate of new state laws, including on guns, minimum wage and gender transition care, went into effect as the calendar flipped to 2024. Perhaps the most significant change bans programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion at publicly funded colleges and universities in Texas. Conservative politicians have targeted these diversity initiatives, known as D.E.I., because they have said that the programs have used taxpayer money to stoke racial division and push a liberal agenda on campuses. The new Texas law follows a similar one that Florida enacted in May to prohibit public colleges and universities from spending funds on D.E.I. initiatives. In other states, Americans will follow new rules on guns and marijuana, as well as have additional health care and workplace protections. About three dozen states enacted new laws on voting in 2023, but most of the practical effects won\u2019t be felt until primary and general elections in 2024. Many of these changes will have an immediate impact on everyday life starting Monday. Here are some other new and noteworthy state laws: Californians will be barred from carrying guns in most public places after an 11th-hour ruling from a federal appeals court. A lower court judge had blocked enforcement of the law earlier in December, but just two days before the law was set to take effect, the appeals court put a hold on the lower court ruling. The law lists more than two dozen locations, including libraries and sports venues, where firearms are prohibited. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia already have red-flag laws that authorize the temporary removal of firearms from people who are deemed dangerous. Minnesota this week became the 20th state to give family members and law enforcement the ability to ask a court to take away guns in certain situations. Next month, a red-flag law will take effect in Michigan, which is also adding more expansive background checks and a safe gun storage law in homes where a child is present.

Photographs by Joe Buglewicz Reporting from New Haven, Conn. For generations, New Haven has been a pizza town. The pies are distinct: more of a meal than the greasy, fold-up-and-go New York slices, more blue-collar than baroque California concoctions. They are a sort of American Neapolitan \u2014 chewy, charred and fresh, but with quirkier toppings than one might find on a traditional pie in Naples. The culture is unique, too. Connecticut natives and Yale University graduates alike hold pointed opinions about which pizzeria is best. Each weekend, lines stretch down Wooster Street and through Wooster Square, as local families and tourists line up for lunch. But in the past few years, things have begun to change.

  "2025-04-26_459986_1": "U.S. Economy Square Feet The slowdown in the residential real estate market, a crucial cog in the American economy, is threatening sectors like home improvement and storage. John Matheson, a home inspector in Alameda, Calif., kept busy during the pandemic when the housing market was red hot. But as interest rates started to rise about halfway through 2022, he noticed that his workload began to drop. Last year, the number of jobs plummeted. \u201cMy business is about 50 percent of what it was,\u201d said Mr. Matheson, who works as a contractor for BPG Inspections, which provides services to home buyers across the nation. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a really bad year.\u201d So bad, in fact, that \u201cI am actually thinking about side hustles,\u201d he said, adding that he is studying to receive a commercial captain\u2019s license in the hope of getting a job operating a ferry or another vessel if the housing market does not rebound. High home prices and elevated mortgage rates, which squeezed the housing market last year, have dragged down a number of other related sectors, like real estate services and mortgage lending. But housing is such a crucial cog in the American economy that its slowdown has also threatened industries like home improvement and storage. \u201cExisting home sales are under so much pressure,\u201d said Sean O\u2019Hara, president of the fund-management firm Pacer ETFs. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of exiting a phase where real estate, across the board, had an excellent environment.\u201d Sales of existing homes, which make up most of the nation\u2019s housing stock, were down roughly 7 percent in November from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.

  "2025-04-26_916356_1": "Catch a mountain trout on a frozen South Korean river, witness a fiery pelting of devotees in Taiwan or find your cold-weather bliss in a Japanese snow maze. For many people, the joys of winter center on strapping on skis, snowshoes or skates and getting outdoors. Of course, that is no less true in many parts of Asia. But with climates ranging from the famously snowy Japanese island of Hokkaido to the tropical forests of Malaysia, the continent offers a wide variety of wintertime delights for travelers who are seeking something different from a day on the slopes. Fresh-caught mountain trout sashimi, anyone? Here are five festivals to check out this winter. South Korea The chance to pluck a sancheoneo, or mountain trout, from a frozen river draws thousands of visitors every winter to a cold-weather-loving corner of South Korea. The annual ice festival, held in Hwacheon County from Jan. 6 to 28 this year, doubles as a tribute to a cherished local fish. To join in, first, buy plastic bait and a pole on the boardwalk along the Hwacheon Stream. Then venture onto the thick ice and claim a predrilled hole in the fishing area. Now, it\u2019s time to start luring some trout. Pro tip: It\u2019s all in the wrist. And in case your aquatic adeptness still feels lacking, experts dart about sharing fishing tips. Between their advice and the abundance of trout in the river, even an amateur\u2019s chances of success are pretty good. Whether or not you fish, you can still get a taste of the fresh catch (alas, not your own) near the fishing area, where a restaurant tent sells the trout fried, grilled and sashimi-style. Order every preparation and savor each with a local beer. After fishing, warm up with some ice sports. Visitors can skate, sled, pedal the fanciful contraption that is an ice bike, and even scoot around crouched or seated on a wooden plank, steering themselves with two sticks (sounds hard, but it\u2019s well worth the exertion once you get gliding).

  "2025-04-26_179051_1": "Whether you want to eat less meat, bake more crowd-pleasing desserts or (finally) learn how to cook, here are some first steps for the new year. Zainab Shah\u2019s sheet-pan paneer tikka is a great introductory recipe for someone who wants to eat more vegetarian dishes in 2024. Credit...Bryan Gardner for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Barrett Washburne. If abiding by resolutions were as easy as setting them, perfection would be attainable and the self-improvement section of the bookstore would be cobweb city. Still, self-reflection can be a rewarding exercise at the beginning of a new year. What better place to start than in the kitchen, where you have to spend at least a little bit of time each day? Consider a gentler approach to resolution-making: Try to become just a little bit better at something, rather than change your habits wholesale. Perhaps you\u2019d like to incorporate Meatless Mondays into your weekly routine, or maybe you\u2019re resolving to bake the birthday cakes for your loved ones this year. Maybe, just maybe, this is the year you finally learn how to cook. No matter what your goals, we have recipes to bring you closer to them. Give these a try in 2024, and, by this time next year, we\u2019re certain you\u2019ll be impressed by how far your cooking has come. Few dishes embody the potential of meatless eating quite like Melissa Clark\u2019s five-star red lentil soup, the most-reviewed recipe in the entire New York Times Cooking database. It expertly executes on the promises of any good vegetarian recipe: It honors the cook\u2019s time. It transforms simple pantry staples and vibrant fresh ingredients like lemon juice and cilantro into something surprisingly complex. And it won\u2019t leave you hunting around the kitchen for something more substantial to eat afterward. Recipe: Red Lentil Soup Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Reporting from Moscow Nadezhda Shtovba did not wear a white dress to her wedding. There were no bridesmaids or groomsmen. She and her husband, Yegor, did not exchange wedding bands either \u2014 rings are banned in Butyrka prison. That is where Yegor Shtovba has spent the past 15 months in pretrial detention. In September 2022, he had read a love poem written for Nadezhda at a public gathering, his first time sharing his work in front of a crowd. He was detained that night as the police raided the event, and was eventually charged with \u201cpublic calls for activities directed against state security.\u201d The police accused him of cheering an antiwar poem read by another poet, an act that he denies. His marriage to Nadezhda, in a short ceremony last month in a prison in downtown Moscow, was the first time the couple had any physical contact since his arrest. \u201cFor 10 minutes, we just stood and hugged,\u201d said the newly minted Ms. Shtovba, who recently turned 18 and sews plush toys for income. The wedding, in the presence of a registrant and prison officials, was a testament to their young love, which can be glorious but also complicated, confusing and hard to navigate even in good circumstances. In Russia, an authoritarian state in the midst of severe crackdown on freedom of expression, it can turn the joyous moment of marriage into a trying struggle.

  "2025-04-26_60926_1": "When you talk to students about social media radicalization, racism and bullying, you learn how desperate they are for some guidance. The sixth-grade boy who raised his hand was wiry and small. \u201cPeople at my school make racist jokes,\u201d he said, when I called on him. His voice had yet to change. \u201cHow do I get them to stop?\u201d I was sitting on a high school stage in Piedmont, Calif., where I had finished a conversation with two high school seniors about my new book, \u201cAccountable,\u201d which was adapted in The New York Times Magazine last August. Both the article and the book tell the story of the turmoil that befell a California high school and its community after some students created and shared racist material on an Instagram account. Since the article and book came out, I have spoken at schools around the country about the issues the story raises: social media radicalization, racism, humor, boy culture, the impacts of bullying and the vexing question of how to respond effectively. This particular audience was made up mostly of adults, and they responded with applause, as if the boy\u2019s mere desire to stop racist jokes was triumph enough. Perhaps it was. But this sixth grader wasn\u2019t looking for approval. He wanted an actual answer, not the platitudes that adults fall back on when asked about the toxic social dynamics of middle and high school: \u201cBe kind!\u201d \u201cSpeak up!\u201d \u201cBe an upstander!\u201d He wanted to know how to get people at his school to stop making racist jokes without becoming the butt of the jokes himself. I talked about having a firm but nonconfrontational phrase ready, something like \u201cDude, that\u2019s messed up.\u201d I talked about how to identify which classmates had the social clout to influence their peers and how to approach those people. I talked about when to get an adult involved and how to choose the right one. But even as I spoke, I was thinking: \u201cYou know I\u2019m just a journalist, right? I\u2019m the one who asks the questions. What makes you think I have the answers?\u201d This is both the joy and the terror of talking to young people about hot-button topics. I usually start by asking students to raise their hands if they\u2019ve seen or heard hate speech online, whether it\u2019s the use of slurs on gaming platforms; racist memes or videos on social media; or ugly remarks in the comment section of an article or video. They all have, of course. We all have. If I\u2019ve managed to engage their attention \u2014 tougher to do just before lunch or during first period, when they\u2019re barely awake \u2014 students will respond to my presentation with questions that reveal both how pertinent the topic is to their lives and how eager they are for guidance. Sometimes the questions are philosophical: \u201cHow do you know if someone is a good person or a bad person?\u201d \u201cYou say that everyone has the capacity to transform, but what if it\u2019s a mass murderer?\u201d Sometimes they are practical: \u201cWhat should we do when we see something racist online?\u201d And often the questions are deeply personal. Usually, at the end of my presentation, there is a small group of students waiting to talk with me. With the sensitivity that is characteristic of their generation, they will keep some space between one another so that the person speaking with me won\u2019t be overheard. Within that small cocoon of privacy, I\u2019ve had a young woman sob in my arms after saying: \u201cThose girls you wrote about must have felt so heard. But nobody listened when it happened to me!\u201d I\u2019ve heard the stories of young people who were the targets of everything from racist remarks to violent bullying. I\u2019ve fielded questions about free speech and the role anger plays in the emotional health of victims. \u201cI did not want to write about my experiences with racism,\u201d Jeena Ann Kidambi, an eighth grader from Framingham, Mass., wrote in an essay about the girls, Ana and A., featured in the Times article because they were targeted by the racist Instagram account. Like A., she wrote, \u201cI did not want to dwell on those memories. However, by writing this essay and embracing my emotions on the subject, I gained closure and released myself from anger\u2019s chokehold.\u201d (The essay won a contest in her school district sponsored by the Swiacki Children\u2019s Literature Festival at Framingham State University.) At one school, a girl spoke so softly that I had to lean close to hear her. Haltingly, with her eyes fixed on the ground, she asked how people could make amends for a harm they caused if the person harmed wouldn\u2019t speak to them. She didn\u2019t tell me what she had done, but I could see that it haunted her \u2014 both the guilt over the injury she had caused and the fear she would be punished in perpetuity. I think about this girl often, wishing I had a better answer to give her. At every school I visit, I remind students that they are works in progress, that during their teenage years they will both be harmed and cause harm, and that they have the capacity to survive both. And each time, I walk away struck by how vulnerable they are to forces that they neither created nor control. Dashka Slater is a writer in California with a focus on teenagers and criminal justice. Her book \u201cThe 57 Bus,\u201d a New York Times best seller, was based on an article she wrote for the magazine in 2015 and went on to win a 2018 Stonewall Book Award from the American Library Association.

It ended in laughter, it got big, it got small.\u201d  The key moment in the smash hit went through many revisions: \u201cWe ended in tears. It ended in laughter, it got big, it got small.\u201d America Ferrera said she went into \u201cBarbie\u201d with no attachment to the main character: \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up playing with Barbies.\u201dCredit...Amy Harrity for The New York Times Listing some of the many perils of womanhood in a still patriarchal society, the monologue that the actress America Ferrera delivers in \u201cBarbie\u201d with the intensity of a rallying cry became one of the most talked-about movie moments of 2023. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of something so eagerly anticipated,\u201d Ferrera said during an interview at a Beverly Hills hotel restaurant. Originally from Los Angeles but based in New York, she was back in her hometown for an awards-season screening of the smash hit. Relaxed in a cozy beige sweater, Ferrera, 39, was recalling a prerelease press stop in Mexico City where 20,000 frenzied people welcomed the filmmaker Greta Gerwig and the cast of her pink-soaked comedy. \u201cIt was like a presidential campaign,\u201d she added. Ferrera plays Gloria, mother and Mattel employee whose self-doubt and unfulfilled aspirations in the real world prompt an existential crisis in Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) in Barbie Land. Ferrera\u2019s plucky performance has landed her in the Oscar discussion this year. Though Gloria might be considered a supporting player in \u201cBarbie,\u201d Ferrera knows that it\u2019s her flawed character who sets the adventure in motion. The performer, who broke through in \u201cReal Women Have Curves\u201d (2002) and went on to win an Emmy for her turn as the title character in \u201cUgly Betty\u201d (2006-10), deeply admires how Gerwig dared to infuse a seemingly vacuous concept with plenty of meaning. \u201cIt\u2019s huge for something that is both so commercially successful and culturally dominant to also be about many things at the same time, which is not easy to execute in the biggest movie of the year,\u201d Ferrera noted. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation. Has the massive success of \u201cBarbie\u201d come as a surprise to you? I went into reading the script with really no attachment to Barbie at all. I didn\u2019t grow up playing with Barbies. I was more curious about what Greta would do with it. It wasn\u2019t just funny and subversive and delightfully weird. It was also about womanhood. When I was done reading the script, I was just giddy that this was the Barbie movie that no one asked for, but we were going to get. I felt it was going to be huge from the beginning. Why did you never play with Barbies as a child? We couldn\u2019t afford Barbies. She was very expensive along with all of her stuff. [Laughs] I had a cousin who had Barbies, and I would play with them at her house, but they also seemed very far away from me. I didn\u2019t necessarily feel represented in the Barbie narrative. It felt like a world that wasn\u2019t accessible to me. Since you didn\u2019t have a personal attachment to Barbie, how did you find your way into the character of Gloria and this world? One of the things that really gave me a glimpse into this character was the documentary called \u201cTiny Shoulders: Rethinking Barbie\u201d that showed when Barbie expanded into many different sizes and shapes and colors. The woman [Kim Culmone] who led that as the head Barbie designer, a very cool feminist progressive woman, was getting backlash from all sides: From the legacy holders saying, \u201cBarbie can\u2019t change.\u201d And from her progressive friends, angry that she cared about Barbie. \u201cWhy would you care about something that has been so bad for women?\u201d But she had her own deep personal connection to playing with Barbies with her mother. She fought for this idea that she knew was imperfect but that still meant something to her. That gave me the insight I needed to play Gloria as a real adult woman and to understand why she plays with Barbie and wishes herself to Barbie Land. What did you think the first time you saw Gloria\u2019s now incredibly popular speech? It definitely felt like an important moment, but Gloria was shining from the very beginning. She represents this quest for the permission to express yourself. She has to play the role of Mom and of responsible career woman, while hiding everything she loves underneath the corporate suit, being what she thought she needed to be. From the moment we meet her with her pink sneakers on to her getting to drive in that car chase, there was so much wish fulfillment and release for somebody who has been repressing so much. The monologue felt so right for Gloria. Yes, it breaks the Barbies out of their moment, but it\u2019s also the natural breaking point for Gloria, where she has to say what she\u2019s discovering on this journey. I recognized that it was a big moment and that it needed to work, but it also didn\u2019t work independent of her entire search for more freedom for herself. Did the speech change at all? The text evolved a little bit. Greta asked me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell me what you would say? Write it in your own words. What would you add?\u201d Not every director starts out by inviting actors to rewrite their work. Some of what we talked about made it into the script. The line, \u201cAlways be grateful\u201d came out of that conversation with Greta. She expounded on it adding, \u201cBut never forget that the system is rigged.\u201d There were many versions that we did. We ended in tears. It ended in laughter, it got big, it got small, and I was able to do that because I really trusted Greta to know what would be right for the film. What are your thoughts on the discourse that some people believe Gloria\u2019s speech oversimplifies feminism? We can know things and still need to hear them out loud. It can still be a cathartic. There are a lot of people who need Feminism 101, whole generations of girls who are just coming up now and who don\u2019t have words for the culture that they\u2019re being raised in. Also, boys and men who may have never spent any time thinking about feminist theory. If you are well-versed in feminism, then it might seem like an oversimplification, but there are entire countries that banned this film for a reason. To say that something that is maybe foundational, or, in some people\u2019s view, basic feminism isn\u2019t needed is an oversimplification. Assuming that everybody is on the same level of knowing and understanding the experience of womanhood is an oversimplification. Gloria\u2019s story is deeply intertwined with that of Barbie. How do you think the two help each other overcome their struggles? Greta, Margot and I talked about Gloria and Barbie\u2019s relationship as a love story. Not necessarily a romantic one, which some people on the internet have pushed for that reading of it, but we talked about it as Barbie and Gloria needing each other to be complete and to be the pieces of a puzzle that\u2019s missing for each of them. The journey releases Gloria of the impossible assignment of being the kind of woman that she thinks she needs to be in the real world. And Barbie releases her herself from having to be an idea that is never going to satisfy all the things she\u2019s meant to satisfy by choosing to be a human. What was your reaction when you first saw the doll made in your image for the Barbie collection inspired by the movie? Surreal. There were actually some similarities to me in the facial features. She\u2019s the first Barbie doll fashioned after a Honduran American woman to ever exist. That\u2019s really special, to know that no one had a Honduran Barbie doll to play with until now. Do you feel like your career has always been marked by firsts, like being the first Latina to win a lead acting Emmy? There\u2019s a lot of pressure in being the first. I just took any single opportunity in front of me to do the best possible work that I could do in the hopes that there would be another opportunity after that. Looking backward, it\u2019s much clearer to see that my career has been shaped by how the culture saw somebody like me. The opportunities that came my way were ones that kept me in very specific boxes. What I saw as my job as an actor was to inject those characters with as much complexity as I could, and not just play characters that were a foil to an expectation. Have things improved for Latinas in Hollywood since \u201cReal Women Have Curves\u201d? It took Josefina L\u00f3pez, who wrote it, 11 years to get that movie made. And when the movie was successful, it didn\u2019t result in a watershed moment for Latina writers and directors and actresses being given tons of opportunities. As you stated, I\u2019m the first Latina to win an Emmy in a lead category. I\u2019m still the only one and that brings me no joy. While I would love to think that things are different today than they were 22 years ago when \u201cReal Women Have Curves\u201d was made, the data shows that in large part, it hasn\u2019t changed. That makes me think of Lupe Ontiveros, who played your mother in \u201cReal Women Have Curves,\u201d and who made a career out of tiny roles she managed to turn into screen gold. She was such a force, an incredible talent. [Ontiveros died in 2012.] I often think about all the incredible performances we were robbed of, that Lupe never got to give because those opportunities didn\u2019t exist for somebody like her. And she still did her work. She took whatever scraps would come to her and she would fill them with humor and make them memorable. I think about her often, and all the Latino actors who\u2019ve come before me, who did whatever they could with whatever they got. What does the ideal future for Latinos in the industry look like to you? The hope is that we get to actually have outlets for the immense talent that exists among Latinos. And that we can move beyond fighting just to be visible and that we can actually create and exist as full humans, as artists, with things to say beyond, \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d But it\u2019s hard to find those opportunities. There\u2019s a lot out there that is very transactional in terms of checking boxes to claim diversity. One of the most exciting things to me about this movie was, as a Latina woman, being invited to be a part of something so adventurous and joyful and fun. Gloria is Latina, but being Latina was not her reason for being in this story. We encourage you to review our updated Terms of Sale, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy.

Kitty, played by Emily Blunt, is the woman behind the man: Though a scientist herself, she is the sidelined wife of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the American physicist who led the development of an atomic weapon during World War II at Los Alamos, N.M. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is emphatically his movie, so much so that a lot of the script was written in the first person (\u201cI OPEN my eyes- JUMP out of bed- SCRAMBLE to dress\u201d). And second, though Kitty was Robert\u2019s wife (they had two children together), she was not his first love nor, the film suggests, his strongest. The psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) was initially involved with Robert for three years, and the two continued to see each other, even after the Oppenheimers were married. Midway through the film, Kitty finds her husband manic over her death. \u201cHow heartbreaking it must have been for her,\u201d Blunt said, \u201cto see him in that kind of state about another woman.\u201d It is all to say that Blunt, the London-born actress known for films such as \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d might have disappeared into the three-hour epic, which was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography \u201cAmerican Prometheus.\u201d But Blunt\u2019s is among the most memorable performances in a film packed with movie stars and acclaimed character actors. The winner of a Screen Actors Guild Award for \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d in 2019, Blunt is now a likely candidate for her first Academy Award nomination.

  "2025-04-26_420397_1": "What to Read Nonfiction This bracing anthology of Christopher Hitchens\u2019s work for The London Review of Books is just the ticket. When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A HITCH IN TIME: Reflections Ready for Reconsideration, by Christopher Hitchens There was a period in the late 1990s or thereabouts when Christopher Hitchens\u2019s byline was, or seemed to be, stamped in every respectable magazine and newspaper published in English. The Nation had his biweekly political columns. The London Review of Books and Newsday (where he wrote weekly) had the bulk of his book reviews. He loitered in Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler and The New Statesman and the TLS and The Atlantic and The New York Times Book Review and Slate and The New York Review of Books as if they were dive bars. Vanity Fair, where he had a monthly column, had the good sense to simply point him at things. The American South, for example. Or his own Brazilian bikini waxing. And his own waterboarding. Much of Hitchens\u2019s fugitive material has made its way into print, sometimes in block-size collections. (The blockiest at nearly 800 pages is \u201cArguably\u201d from 2011, the year of his death.) But some of it has not. A few years ago, I received in my inbox a bootleg assortment of his Newsday reviews, which remain unpublished. And here now is \u201cA Hitch in Time: Reflections Ready for Reconsideration.\u201d These are book reviews and diary essays written for The London Review of Books between 1983 and 2002. None has previously been anthologized. The pieces are split almost evenly between political topics (Margaret Thatcher, Bill Clinton, the Oklahoma bombing, Nixon and Kennedy, Kim Philby, the radicalism of 1968) and literary, academic and social ones (Tom Wolfe, the Academy Awards, Salman Rushdie, P.G. Wodehouse, spanking, Gore Vidal, Diana Mosley, Isaiah Berlin). These slashing pieces often attracted angry letters, a few of which are printed here. Hitchens\u2019s rebuttals are printed, too. They remind me of Kafka\u2019s injunction, in his diaries, to \u201cuse the attacker\u2019s horse for one\u2019s own ride.\u201d It is no accident that this miscellany ends in 2002. That was the year Hitchens, previously a self-described \u201cextreme leftist,\u201d came out in favor of the invasion of Iraq. He broke with The Nation, The London Review of Books and many of his old friends. \u201cThe evening sky crimsoned from all the bridges he burned,\u201d James Wolcott writes in this collection\u2019s introduction. Wolcott refers to the post-Iraq War Hitchens as \u201cHitchens 2.0.\u201d The essays here return to us the original, classic flavor. Why care about a pile of old book reviews? Hitchens\u2019s didn\u2019t sound like other people\u2019s. He had none of the form\u2019s mannerisms. He rarely praised or blamed; instead, he made distinctions, and he piled up evidence. Often, he barely mentioned the book at hand. This must have infuriated authors, but his readers benefited. For him, the books were occasions; he picked up the bits that interested him and ran with them. (\u201cIt\u2019s a book review, not a bouillon cube,\u201d as Nicholson Baker put it, replying to Ken Auletta, who had complained about one of Baker\u2019s similarly rangy reviews in the Book Review.)

Here are just a few of the big topics that will shape the 2024 election. Of all the items on this list, this is probably the least consequential. But it is first up on the calendar, with the early primary contests just a few weeks away, and a Haley win in New Hampshire or South Carolina is neither impossible nor irrelevant. Heading into the holidays, surveys showed Ms. Haley approaching or exceeding 30 percent in New Hampshire \u2014 putting her closer to an upset than it might look, given the volatile nature of early primaries. Her path to victory in New Hampshire is still fairly narrow. Her recent stumble in answering a question about the cause of the Civil War may halt her momentum. And even if she does defeat Donald J. Trump in the state, it\u2019s hard to see her posing a serious threat to win the nomination, given the relatively narrow, factional character of her appeal.

  "2025-04-26_439380_1": "The former president is leading by impressive margins in the state, but his campaign wants to make sure his supporters turn out. Michael Gold reported from Des Moines, Coralville and Waterloo, Iowa. Kellen Browning reported from Urbandale and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. As former President Donald J. Trump campaigned in Iowa in the fall, he projected the utmost confidence. He told his supporters during speeches that his advisers had constantly warned him not to take the state for granted. Buoyed by his dominance in state polls, Mr. Trump insisted he had no reason to worry. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the Iowa caucuses in a historic landslide,\u201d Mr. Trump predicted in speeches in September and October. But as he returned to Iowa last month, with the state\u2019s caucuses on Jan. 15 fast approaching, Mr. Trump injected a note of concern. Though he retained his confidence, he warned his supporters of a rising threat: complacency. \u201cThe poll numbers are scary, because we\u2019re leading by so much,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Dec. 19 in Waterloo during his final trip to Iowa of 2023. \u201cThe key is, you have to get out and vote.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t sit home and say, \u2018I think we\u2019ll take it easy, darling. It\u2019s a wonderful day, beautiful. Let\u2019s just take it easy, watch television and watch the results,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump later added. \u201cNo, because crazy things can happen.\u201d With just two weeks until Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation nominating contest, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign is dedicated to meeting high expectations and avoiding a repeat of 2016, when Mr. Trump narrowly came in second in Iowa despite being ahead in polls.

  "2025-04-26_298075_1": "Trump Administration Sidebar The former president says his acquittal by the Senate in his second impeachment trial, for inciting insurrection, bars any prosecution on similar grounds. Reporting from Washington There is almost nothing in the words of the Constitution that even begins to support former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s boldest defense against charges that he plotted to overturn the 2020 election: that he is absolutely immune from prosecution for actions he took while in office. A federal appeals court will hear arguments on the question next week, and the panel will consider factors including history, precedent and the separation of powers. But, as the Supreme Court has acknowledged, the Constitution itself does not explicitly address the existence or scope of presidential immunity. In his appellate brief, Mr. Trump said there was one constitutional provision that figured in the analysis, though his argument is a legal long shot. The provision, the impeachment judgment clause, says that officials impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate are still subject to criminal prosecution. The provision says: \u201cJudgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States: But the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.\u201d All the clause says in so many words, then, is that \u201cthe party convicted\u201d in the Senate can still face criminal prosecution. But Mr. Trump said the clause implied something more. The clause \u201cpresupposes that a president who is not convicted may not be subject to criminal prosecution,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s brief said.

Les McCann, a jazz pianist and vocalist who was an early progenitor of the bluesy, crowd-pleasing style that came to be known as soul jazz, and who, although he released more than 50 albums, was best known for a happenstance hit from 1969, died on Friday in Los Angeles. He was 88. His death, at a hospital where he had been admitted with pneumonia, was confirmed on Monday by Alan Abrahams, his longtime manager and a producer of several of his albums. Mr. McCann had lived for the past four years at a skilled nursing facility in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles. Mr. McCann\u2019s earthy, uplifting approach to music was a product of his upbringing in a churchgoing family. As he came to emphasize his singing more and play electric keyboards, his albums, released from 1960 to 2018, influenced funk and R&B artists and became a rich vein for hip-hop artists to mine. His greatest commercial success, though, came purely by chance, in June 1969 at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. Already a recording veteran by then, with albums on Pacific Jazz, Limelight and, most recently, Atlantic, Mr. McCann was appearing at the festival for the first time. After he and the tenor saxophonist Eddie Harris, also an Atlantic artist, played separate sets, they gave an unscheduled performance together, with Mr. Harris as well as the expatriate trumpeter Benny Bailey joining Mr. McCann\u2019s trio. Neither had played with Mr. McCann before, and there was no time for rehearsal. But the performance was to be recorded and filmed for broadcast. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

So far, police prosecutions have resulted in a mixed bag of convictions, acquittals and a mistrial. Protesters gathered after the verdict was read in the Manny Ellis case in Tacoma, Wash.Credit...Maddy Grassy/Associated Press Audra D.S. Burch writes about race and identity. Kelley Manley reported from Aurora, Colo. A few days before Christmas, a jury in Washington cleared three Tacoma police officers of criminal charges in the death of Manuel \u201cManny\u201d Ellis, a 33-year-old Black man who died in police custody in 2020 after pleading that he could not breathe. The next day, on Dec. 22, a jury in Colorado convicted two paramedics of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who died in police custody in 2019 after officers subdued him and medics injected him with the powerful sedative ketamine. In the three years since the murder of George Floyd, whose death in police custody ignited a national movement against police brutality, prosecutors have charged the police and emergency medical workers in a number of high-profile cases. The result has been a mixed bag of verdicts: convictions, acquittals and in one case, a mistrial. Civil rights activists and legal experts say the different outcomes reflect a country still struggling with how to view cases of police use of lethal force, and shifting public sentiment on law enforcement and safety. \u201cPolice accountability is still up for debate. Even with actual evidence, even with body cam footage, we\u2019re still in a place where we cannot be certain that an officer\u2019s conviction for wrongdoing will take place through our judicial system,\u201d Charles Coleman Jr., a civil rights lawyer, former Brooklyn prosecutor and MSNBC legal analyst, said in an interview in October.

For months, I\u2019ve been researching ways that people can restore and maintain their energy levels. Today begins what we\u2019re calling the 6-Day Energy Challenge, where we will share evidence-based tips and inspiration so you can feel more awake throughout the day. (You can sign up here to follow along.) Of course, some of the things that drain us are largely beyond our control: Taking care of young kids or older parents, working long hours, or dealing with illness can all be exhausting. But there are small changes anyone can make to feel a little less depleted. While a good night\u2019s sleep is the gold standard for feeling refreshed and alert, daytime rest has real benefits. Many of us, for example, rush from one activity to the next without stopping. But research suggests that taking microbreaks \u2014 small pauses under five minutes \u2014 throughout the day can help keep us feeling energized. Even 10 seconds of rest, one study found, can improve our ability to learn. Of all the tools I learned while researching the challenge, nothing has done more to restore my energy levels than these brief breaks. But everyone is different. Some of us could use more movement \u2014 and others might need to address relationships that are sapping their energy. We identified five realms that are critical for building and maintaining energy: rest, exercise, socializing, eating and finding enjoyment in what you\u2019re doing. Each day of the challenge will focus on one of these aspects. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like. Jancee Dunn is the columnist for Well\u2019s subscriber-only newsletter.

It\u2019s a sign of China\u2019s rapid growth in EVs. Reporting from Seoul The Chinese corporate giant BYD said Monday that it sold three million battery-powered cars in 2023, its most ever, capping a turbulent year for China\u2019s electric vehicle industry. Even as sales surged, heavy competition and a sustained price war took a financial toll on many automakers. But BYD last year sold 1.6 million fully electric vehicles and another 1.4 million hybrids, which are powered by both batteries and gasoline. Together that is a 62 percent increase over 2022. BYD is also making money, tripling its profit to $1.5 billion in the first half of last year. All told, Chinese automakers are expected to have sold about 9.4 million electric vehicles and hybrids last year, an increase from 6.9 million in 2022, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The group said it expected sales in 2024 to rise again, to 11.5 million. Already the world\u2019s largest automobile market, China is now also its fastest growing, racing ahead in the electric vehicle transition that is upending the global industry. China rules the supply chain for battery-powered cars \u2014 from the mining and processing of cobalt and other minerals used in batteries, to the deployment of robots in factories that make cars and trucks. China\u2019s electric vehicle companies and their suppliers employ some 1.5 million people. A big reason for China\u2019s early lead in electric vehicles was the government\u2019s heavy financial support for the industry\u2019s development. After financial incentives for consumers expired at the end of 2022, automakers slashed car prices to lure buyers. Many companies, including BYD, introduced another round of cuts this fall, intensifying the price war. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_66449_1": "Middle East Tensions Analysts say the announcement could signal a shift to the more limited and targeted war against Hamas that the United States has been urging. Aaron Boxerman and Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Eric Schmitt from Washington. The Israeli military said on Monday that it would begin withdrawing several thousand troops from the Gaza Strip at least temporarily, in what was the most significant publicly announced reduction since the war with Hamas began. The military cited a growing toll on the Israeli economy after nearly three months of wartime mobilization with little end in sight to the fighting. Israel had been considering scaling back its operations, and the United States has been prodding it to do so more quickly as the death toll and privation in Gaza rose. More than 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war, most of them civilians, according to the local health authorities, primarily in Israeli bombing. With aid delivery restricted and aid workers unable to move safely within the territory, half of Gaza\u2019s roughly 2.2 million people are at risk of starvation, according to the United Nations. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, emphasized that the move to demobilize some soldiers did not suggest any compromise of Israel\u2019s intention to continue fighting until it destroys Hamas, and the fighting across Gaza remained intense. Admiral Hagari, who had said he expected \u201cwarfare throughout this year,\u201d indicated that some troops would be called back to service in 2024. He did not mention the American requests to scale back, and Israeli officials have not declared any shift toward a more limited, targeted phase of the war in Gaza, though they have said such a transition would come. But military analysts and U.S. officials say the troop withdrawal probably signals that such a change has begun, though they caution that the war is nowhere near over.

  "2025-04-26_581184_1": "Examining the linguistic persistence of Swiftian wordplay. To be a Swiftie in the year 1729 might have meant that you fawned over the works of an Anglo-Irish writer named Jonathan, who would later be considered the \u201cforemost prose satirist in the English language.\u201d Centuries later, in the years leading up to 1989 (but still long before the release of \u201c1989\u201d), Swifties were jokes invoking Tom Swift, the hero of a series of pulp novels. The joke format, inspired by a writing quirk of the books, featured a dialogue tag tacked onto a spoken phrase so that the result was a groan-inducing one-liner. \u201c\u2018Do you feel a draft?\u2019 Tom asked coolly,\u201d a Tom Swifty might go, or \u201c\u2018You must be my host,\u2019 Tom guessed.\u201d Neither of these literary precedents is likely to mean much to the modern Swiftie, an acolyte of Taylor Swift. The chart-topping singer has a reputation \u2014 get it? \u2014 as a linguistic maverick, writing lyrics that toggle between mixed metaphor and catchy confessional and fall into three categories that Ms. Swift calls \u201cfountain pen\u201d (narrative), \u201cquill\u201d (antiquated) and \u201cglitter gel pen\u201d (girly pop). All that context hopping makes for a grand, Taylor-themed puzzle that Swifties never tire of solving. If Beatles fans are wont to sit around a table discussing whether \u201cLucy in the Sky With Diamonds\u201d is a song about LSD, Swifties are more likely to be found relitigating secret messages hidden in the song \u201cRed\u201d and its liner notes: Was \u201cmaple latte\u201d about a drink she once ordered in a caf\u00e9 with Jake Gyllenhaal, for example? And is \u201cSAG\u201d a reference to Mr. Gyllenhaal\u2019s zodiac sign or his membership in the Screen Actors Guild? \u201cWhen we\u2019re right, it\u2019s really fun, and when we\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s even more fun,\u201d said Katherine Coleman, a 32-year-old comedian based in New York City who identifies as a Swiftie. Ms. Coleman, who wryly claims in her Instagram bio to be Ms. Swift\u2019s \u201chead of recruitment,\u201d explained that for fans, the joy of Swiftian wordplay is not in ferreting out an absolute truth to Ms. Swift\u2019s words, but in testing the limits of what they could mean \u2014 what she referred to as the \u201cclowning of it all.\u201d Virginia Smith, a 35-year-old journalist who attended Ms. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour in May, wrote in an email that embracing her fandom for Ms. Swift felt like \u201ca kind of catharsis,\u201d which she suggested was tied \u201cto a larger cultural moment that\u2019s happening about allowing people to reclaim various forms of joy.\u201d And Swifties do seem capable of spinning nonsense into glitter-gel-pen joy wherever they go. They brush aside any criticism of Ms. Swift\u2019s songs and find a kind of celebratory indifference in affirming both the singer and one another, by encoding song titles and lyrics into cryptic initialisms on friendship bracelets or launching typos into the global meme stratosphere. \u201cTaylor Swift was eating a piece of chicken with ketchup and seemingly ranch!\u201d a fan reported from a Kansas City Chiefs football game Ms. Swift attended in September. Within days, Swifties had spun \u201cseemingly ranch\u201d into a meme so absurd \u2014 and so confident in its grammar \u2014 that it caught global brands\u2019 attention. The Empire State Building changed its colors, and McDonald\u2019s advertised a dip pairing with the phrase \u201cdefinitely McNuggets.\u201d Cynthia Gordon, an associate professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, suggested that fans might have taken a cue from Ms. Swift\u2019s penchant for putting language-driven Easter eggs in her music and built double entendres and wordplay of their own. Take, for example, the 20-letter Swiftie initialism A.T.W.T.M.V.T.V.F.T.V.S.G.A.V.R.A.L.P.S., which Ms. Coleman identified \u201cinstantly\u201d as meaning \u201cAll Too Well (Ten Minute Version) (Taylor\u2019s Version) (From the Vault) (Sad Girl Autumn Version) (Recorded at Long Pond Studios).\u201d \u201cThe initialisms are ridiculously long,\u201d Dr. Gordon said, \u201cwhich suggests to me there is an extra bit of mischief and play in them.\u201d Various attempts have been made over the years to string together the three witty Swifts into some sort of dynasty. In Vanity Fair, Mark Summers sketched the lineage from Jonathan to Taylor, and in McSweeney\u2019s, Grant Suhs wrote a set of \u201cTaylor Swifties\u201d \u2014 Tom Swifties using Ms. Swift\u2019s lyrics. The premise of continuity between these literary generations, thin as it may be, is one means of explaining Ms. Swift\u2019s staying power in our cultural consciousness. What is notable here is that fan language has earned a place in the canon alongside her: When Time magazine chose Taylor Swift as 2023\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year,\u201d it noted the spread of \u201cseemingly ranch\u201d on social media. According to Dr. Gordon, the use of social media can give nonsensical language what linguists refer to as \u201cpersistence.\u201d \u201cThis means it\u2019s easy to refer back to, to forward and to cut-and-paste,\u201d Dr. Gordon explained of the acronyms and nonsense phrases that have become Swiftie lore. \u201cSocial media can help circulate terms like this that are likely more playful than practical.\u201d Persistence may be the best explanation for Swiftie \u201cfanilect\u201d \u2014 Dr. Gordon\u2019s own play on \u201cfamilect,\u201d a term for in-group speech among families. Swifties can pick up a seemingly trivial phrase and transmute it into something that demands public attention. And just as Ms. Swift adapts her lyrics to different romantic relationships \u2014 putting her new boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in the lyrics of \u201cKarma,\u201d for example \u2014 her fans use her words to suit their own scenarios, real or imagined. Ms. Swift can be your doctor, diagnosing you with \u201cbad blood.\u201d The fans may be joking, but their belief in Ms. Swift\u2019s versatility is real. And their wordplay is a means to declare a linguistic prowess of their own \u2014 Taylor\u2019s lyrics (fans\u2019 version).

  "2025-04-26_873751_1": "Guest Essay Ms. King is an associate professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My 7-year-old son, Carl, realized that it was Tuesday and asked why Robert was not coming to our house that day. Robert had been a caregiver for my husband, Ady Barkan, for more than five years, helping with Ady\u2019s day-to-day activities as he became progressively paralyzed because of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S. Tuesdays were Robert\u2019s days, when he would help Ady work during the day and pick up Carl and his sister, Willow, in the afternoon, often going out for an activity in our red wheelchair-accessible van. Robert also helped Ady get into bed four nights a week, arriving around the kids\u2019 bedtime and staying until 10 p.m. Ady died from complications of A.L.S. in early November. Since then, the bustle of caregivers around our house has been strangely suspended for the first time in years. The kids didn\u2019t understand why Robert couldn\u2019t come anyway, so I texted to invite him for dinner. We had our usual Tuesday meal of tacos, which Ady had branded \u201cTaco Martes\u201d; while I cooked, Carl, Willow and Robert played Uno in the living room. Ady and I had close relationships with his caregivers, many of whom worked with us for years. They allowed Ady to continue to live in our home, surrounded by his family, even after his paralysis had progressed to the point where I could not care for him on my own. It\u2019s likely that most A.L.S. patients do not have access to this kind of support \u2014 or to adequate caregiving in general. Health insurance plans cover little, if any, in-home caregiving to assist with the tasks of daily life (as opposed to skilled nursing services, which administer medicines and change bandages, for example). Medicare also does not cover assistance with activities like bathing and dressing. To qualify for Medicaid \u2014 which varies state by state and has lengthy wait lists for home care \u2014 patients and their families usually must exhaust almost all of their assets first, which would have left me, as a now 39-year-old widow, with almost no savings. We were fortunate to arrive at an ad hoc arrangement with our health insurance company that reimbursed most of Ady\u2019s caregiving costs, which totaled about $40,000 a month for round-the-clock care. You read that right \u2014 by the end of his life, we paid nearly half a million dollars a year for Ady\u2019s care. Living with A.L.S. offers an extreme example of the care crisis that the United States is facing right now. Private caregiving is exorbitantly expensive, even as more Americans will need paid care in the coming years. The pandemic revealed how much our society relies on caregivers, but we have failed to make changes to our insufficient caregiving system. Political action to make home care more affordable and available seems to have stalled in our divided Congress. We cannot accept this status quo. In this election year, candidates will present their platforms to voters. We have the opportunity to push those seeking office to prioritize a care agenda that would recognize the importance of caregiving to millions of people\u2019s lives. We can ask how they will support patients and caregivers so that more people can enjoy the quality of life that Ady\u2019s caregivers made possible. Ady was diagnosed with A.L.S. in 2016, when Carl was 4 months old. In 2019, he underwent a tracheotomy, which inserted a tube into his windpipe so that a ventilator could breathe for him. A tracheotomy turns A.L.S. from a terminal illness into a long-term condition, but it also requires constant maintenance: suctioning secretions, changing the tubing and responding to any alarms on the ventilator. Because Ady was paralyzed and could not perform these actions himself, he needed 24/7 caregiving support provided by a team of nine caregivers, including Robert. Early in Ady\u2019s illness, he and I had resisted hiring caregivers, wanting to hold on to our normal life and fearing that having strangers in our home would be too intrusive. But once we reached the stage when we needed additional help, it turned out that having it allowed a little normalcy back into our lives. He and I could be partners again, rather than patient and caregiver. We could relax, chat and watch TV in the evenings, instead of my going through an hourslong routine \u2014 after putting our children to sleep first \u2014 to get him ready for bed. To be candid, hiring caregivers saved our marriage. But because of the high cost of private caregiving, most people with A.L.S. face a choice: They can live in a nursing home, funded by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance; they can rely on family caregivers, who must then often leave their jobs to provide full-time care; or they can elect to die by physician-assisted suicide. Most simply cannot afford or get access to the round-the-clock caregiving that is necessary for someone with the disease and others like it. The need for long-term caregiving is not unique to those with A.L.S. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has found that 70 percent of people over 65 need long-term services and support, and that those needs are concentrated in poorer households. Yet only about 3 to 4 percent of Americans over age 50 have long-term care insurance. A 2019 report published by the Department of Health and Human Services found that 48 percent of people over 65 received some paid care, but many relied on family and other unpaid caregivers. Medicare generally does not cover long-term care, and more than 650,000 people are on Medicaid waiting lists or interest lists for home and community-based services. As the current population continues to age, more people will need long-term care than ever before. The care crisis also directly affects caregivers, who are overworked, underpaid and underappreciated. The median wage for a direct care worker was $15.43 an hour in 2022, meaning that many caregivers live in poverty and rely on public assistance. The work can be exhausting and difficult, with many caregivers working multiple part-time jobs. However, we often devalue this work by thinking of in-home caregivers as \u201chelp\u201d rather than as medical professionals. Because we hired private caregivers, Ady and I were able to offer them benefits such as paid sick days and a severance package when he died. His caregivers earned a living wage based on the specialized skills required for different aspects of the job. Early in his career, Ady helped write the legislation guaranteeing workers in New York City paid sick leave, and he was determined to make caregiving a stable, sustainable career. Because training new caregivers could take weeks or months, it was crucial for him to have a reliable crew. On Sept. 8, 2021, Ady wrote in these pages about the benefits that his caregivers brought to his life and called on the president and Congress to fund home care. Despite branding caregivers as \u201cessential workers\u201d during the pandemic, we have failed to make any changes to our insufficient caregiving system. In 2022, a proposed $150 billion in funding for Medicaid home and community-based services, or H.C.B.S., was stripped from President Biden\u2019s Build Back Better legislation. When the reformulated Inflation Reduction Act finally passed, it did not include funding for H.C.B.S. But the urgency of the problems has not diminished and we must continue to call on elected officials to act. Officials have proposed legislative solutions to some shortcomings of our current system. The Better Care Better Jobs Act bill, introduced into Congress last January, would expand eligibility for home and community-based services, such as in-home caregiving, for millions of people. It would also increase wages and benefits and help caregivers organize, making these jobs more appealing and secure. Another bill, the H.C.B.S. Access Act, introduced last spring, would make H.C.B.S. coverage mandatory under Medicaid for all eligible people, helping them move off waiting lists, as well as strengthen wages and support for caregivers. Neither proposal advanced out of committee, even though Americans are largely in favor of policies that support paid and unpaid caregiving. Support for caregiving is bipartisan, but funding it has unfortunately become a partisan football, tossed back and forth in our increasingly dysfunctional Congress. But caregiving is a way of life \u2014 a necessity imposed upon many people who cannot afford paid caregivers, but also a beautiful expression of love and community. Just as having caregivers in our home allowed us to feel more like a family, so too can caregiving be both a burden and a blessing. It was one of the most profound experiences of my life to care for Ady as he became progressively disabled, but I could not have done it without the caregivers, teachers, babysitters, friends and family who have cared for Ady, our children and me over the years. Now that Ady is gone, I know that one of the most beautiful aspects of his awful disease was this community of care that we created around him. Far from disrupting our privacy, the caregivers and other friends and family who supported us through Ady\u2019s illness allowed us to live in a more communal way \u2014 one that Americans often idealize while finding it difficult to achieve. Rather than living in a traditional nuclear family, my children live surrounded by many loving adults who contribute to their care. Ady believed in a world where sick and disabled people were not isolated in their homes or segregated in skilled nursing facilities, and where caregiving was a career that offered dignity and financial stability. As he frequently noted, it is unconscionable that the richest nation in the world refuses to provide this basic social safety net for its citizens \u2014 to fulfill the moral obligation of allowing people to maintain a sustainable quality of life that recognizes their full humanity. After Ady\u2019s death, leaders from across the government and public policy commemorated his activism. One way to honor his legacy is to make sure that everyone has access to the high-quality care that brought joy and contentment to the last few years of his life. Rachael Scarborough King is an associate professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she specializes in 18th-century British literature. She is writing a book about caregiving within the nuclear family and how to imagine care more expansively. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

  "2025-04-26_540610_1": "David Firestone Mr. Firestone is a member of the editorial board. In mid-December, just one day after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed into law a radical new immigration bill, immigrant rights groups challenged it in court as ridiculously unconstitutional. The groups felt they had no choice, but they did exactly what Texas was counting on, because the point of the law isn\u2019t simply how outrageous it is; it\u2019s about the fight it will cause. And nothing defines Mr. Abbott\u2019s governorship more than his endless fights against Washington, almost always in a way that hurts the poor, the stateless and those who live outside the boundaries of his state\u2019s Republican culture. The new law gives Texas the power to take over immigration enforcement from the federal government. It\u2019s now a state crime to cross from Mexico to Texas at an unauthorized crossing; state police are empowered to arrest migrants, and state judges are empowered to order them to leave the country. Forget all those niceties about asylum policy; if Texas doesn\u2019t want you in the state, it can kick you back over the border. None of this is legal, of course. Only the federal government can set immigration policy and enforce border security. Only the federal government can arrest migrants for immigration violations or deport them. The Supreme Court made that clear in 2012 in a decision that prohibited Arizona from arresting people for being in the country without authorization. \u201cThe government of the United States has broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens,\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court\u2019s majority, citing the government\u2019s constitutional power to regulate naturalization and control relations with foreign nations. \u201cArizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration,\u201d the decision says, \u201cbut the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.\u201d Texas is well aware that it is deliberately defying the Arizona decision, but it also knows that Mississippi achieved a historic win for conservatives when it defied settled law by prohibiting most abortions after 15 weeks, setting the stage for the Supreme Court to then overturn Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization in 2022. The court has changed significantly since the Arizona case, largely thanks to Donald Trump, and Mr. Abbott is openly hoping the more conservative majority will discard the Arizona precedent, just as it did abortion rights.

  "2025-04-26_835316_1": "Guest Essay Ms. Barbara, who covers Brazilian politics, culture and everyday life, wrote from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. I was nursing a 4-month-old baby when Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil\u2019s presidential election in 2018. It was a disaster, and I knew it right away. My daughter \u2014 let\u2019s call her Potato \u2014 kept on sucking while I shed tears over her head. Then I changed her into a rainbow onesie to indicate my displeasure with our future president, who once said he was \u201cproud to be homophobic.\u201d There was not much else I could do in my state of exhaustion and despair. But then, on one of those lonely nights of breastfeeding, I started to tell Potato random stories, just to feel less alone and to divert my sad thoughts. Little did I know that this, the simple act of telling tales, would see us through an unhinged far-right presidency and a devastating pandemic. In the toughest of times, it was a lifeline. I remember the story that started everything: It was the tale of Damon and Pythias, which I had read somewhere and wanted to pass along. According to the myth, they were best friends who traveled to Syracuse, where Pythias did something unpleasant to King Dionysius and was sentenced to death. Pythias wanted to say goodbye to his family, so Damon offered himself as a hostage while Pythias settled his affairs. The king agreed. Nobody expected Pythias to return, but he did. Dionysius was so moved by the demonstration of friendship that he revoked the death sentence. When I relayed the story\u2019s ending, I swear that my baby stopped feeding for a second, her big brown eyes looking at me inquiringly. After that, I decided to tell her any anecdote that came to mind and sounded even remotely child appropriate. This helped me a lot during late-night diaper changes, especially when I also needed to change Potato\u2019s soaked bed linens while distracting a cold, outraged baby. She paid attention \u2014 first to my intonations and then to the narrative, as she began to understand our language. I told her stories of the day I slipped off a boat, the day my bus broke down, the day I mistook apples for tomatoes, the day two buckets flew away through our window, whatever. She loved the story of a friend who was stung by a bee and continued to play a recreational volleyball match with a swollen foot; it\u2019s graphic, it\u2019s heroic, it\u2019s fun. A little more than a year later, when Potato was a toddler learning to walk and talk, Covid-19 reached the country. By then, I was telling her stories about the environment, Indigenous tribes, the Amazon rainforest and the soaring deforestation rates under Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s watch. Then we began to chat about pathogens, masks, vaccines and science denialists \u2014 like the leader of our country, who aimed for herd immunity and worked against vaccines.

  "2025-04-26_175284_1": "Guest Essay Contributing Opinion Writer In mid-October, a few days after the attack on Israel, a friend sent me a text from a rabbi. She said she couldn\u2019t look away from the horror on the news but felt completely numb. She was struggling to feel even the tiniest bit useful: \u201cWhat can I even do?\u201d Many people are feeling similarly defeated, and many others are outraged by the political inaction that ensues. A Muslim colleague of mine said she was appalled to see so much indifference to the atrocities and innocent lives lost in Gaza and Israel. How could anyone just go on as if nothing had happened? A common conclusion is that people just don\u2019t care. But inaction isn\u2019t always caused by apathy. It can also be the product of empathy. More specifically, it can be the result of what psychologists call empathic distress: hurting for others while feeling unable to help. I felt it intensely this fall, as violence escalated abroad and anger echoed across the United States. Helpless as a teacher, unsure of how to protect my students from hostility and hate. Useless as a psychologist and writer, finding words too empty to offer any hope. Powerless as a parent, searching for ways to reassure my kids that the world is a safe place and most people are good. Soon I found myself avoiding the news altogether and changing the subject when war came up. Understanding how empathy can immobilize us like that is a critical step for helping others \u2014 and ourselves. Empathic distress explains why many people have checked out in the wake of these tragedies. The small gestures they could make seem like an exercise in futility. Giving to charity feels like a drop in the ocean. Posting on social media is poking a hornet\u2019s nest. Having concluded that nothing they do will make a difference, they start to become indifferent. The symptoms of empathic distress were originally diagnosed in health care, with nurses and doctors who appeared to become insensitive to the pain of their patients. Early researchers labeled it compassion fatigue and described it as the cost of caring. The theory was that seeing so much suffering is a form of vicarious trauma that depletes us until we no longer have enough energy to care. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

  "2025-04-26_47374_1": "Katherine Miller Ms. Miller is a staff writer and editor in Opinion. When was the last time you listened to Donald Trump speak at length? There\u2019s a qualitative way to think about this question, about the substance of what he\u2019s saying: He is still talking \u2014 perhaps more than people realize \u2014 about how the last election was stolen from him, and he treats the 2020 election as a Year Zero event that has ruined the world. But there\u2019s a second \u2014 quantitative \u2014 way of looking at this question. In 2015 and 2016, as he was becoming the Republican nominee the first time, Mr. Trump quickly transformed into an all-encompassing, central figure, in an evolving, building story that started like a dark joke that Mr. Trump was in on, then swooned into a reality. Around this time eight years ago, terrorist mass shootings took place in Paris and California as the race for the Republican nomination became increasingly dark. It seemed to click into place then that Mr. Trump\u2019s fluid plans, reactionary ideas, jokes and lies could coexist with and shape grave events. The combined effect of all this was to concentrate the country\u2019s attention like a supernova; reaction to Mr. Trump became a constant feature of politics and also people\u2019s personal lives. But the path toward his likely renomination feels relatively muted, as if the country were wandering through a mist, only to find ourselves back where we started, except older and wearier, and the candidates the same. \u201cThe street still hopes for somebody else,\u201d one Trump-critical donor recently said of Wall Street donors, a kind of dreamy summary of where things stand. Sarah Longwell, who\u2019s overseen regular focus groups, noted on her podcast this fall that many voters seem not to have clocked that Mr. Trump and President Biden are likely to be the nominees. \u201cPeople are constantly telling me, \u2018But couldn\u2019t this happen? But couldn\u2019t this happen?\u2019\u201d If Mr. Trump were to win the first two contests by large enough margins, the general election could essentially begin as early as next month. Why does the volume around Mr. Trump feel different? For one thing, he has opted out of two old ways he achieved omnipresence, no longer tweeting and no longer appearing at Republican debates. Eight years in, there is also a lack of suspense about whether Mr. Trump could become the Republican nominee or the president. A big change is structural, however. In 2016, a good deal of the old, postwar structure of media remained in place, like evening news broadcasts, along with the cable news apparatus that got layered on during the 1990s and the basic infrastructure of digital news in the 2000s. The 2016 election was the first in which a supermajority of Americans owned smartphones. Phone news push alerts gained prominence in 2015 and 2016, just in time for each turn of that unbelievable thing happening in the country. Twitter introduced the quote-tweet function in 2015 and shifted toward an algorithmic timeline in the spring of 2016; the combination juiced essentially every Trump tweet into a conflict that sat there like an electromagnet. Mentions of Mr. Trump on Facebook were so prominent and constant, they could barely be compared with those of the other candidates. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_534882_1": "OpinionPaul Krugman Credit...Bettmann, via Getty Images Opinion Columnist Almost four years have passed since Covid-19 struck. In America, the pandemic killed well over a million people and left millions more with lingering health problems. Much of normal life came to a halt, partly because of official lockdowns but largely because fear of infection kept people home. The big question in the years that followed was whether America would ever fully recover from that shock. In 2023 we got the answer: yes. Our economy and society have, in fact, healed remarkably well. The big remaining question is when, if ever, the public will be ready to accept the good news. In the short run, of course, the pandemic had severe economic and social effects, in many ways wider and deeper than almost anyone expected. Employment fell by 25 million in a matter of weeks. Huge government aid limited families\u2019 financial hardship, but maintaining Americans\u2019 purchasing power in the face of a disrupted economy meant that demand often exceeded supply, and the result was overstretched supply chains and a burst of inflation. At the same time, the pandemic reduced social interactions and left many people feeling isolated. The psychological toll is hard to measure, but the weakening of social ties contributed to a range of negative trends, including a surge in violent crime. It was easy to imagine that the pandemic experience would leave long-term scars \u2014 that long Covid and early retirements would leave us with a permanently reduced labor force, that getting inflation down would require years of high unemployment, that the crime surge heralded a sustained breakdown in public order. But none of that happened. You may have heard about the good economic news. Labor force participation \u2014 the share of adults in today\u2019s work force \u2014 is actually slightly higher than the Congressional Budget Office predicted before the pandemic. Measures of underlying inflation have fallen more or less back to the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target even though unemployment is near a 50-year low. Adjusted for inflation, most workers\u2019 wages have gone up. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

The Metropolitan Opera says its new production of \u201cCarmen\u201d aims at \u201creinvigorating the classic story.\u201d To that end, the director Carrie Cracknell has updated Bizet\u2019s tale of a heedless, headstrong woman and her tragic fate from early-19th-century Spain to present-day America.

The bland, lethargic staging, which opened on New Year\u2019s Eve, falls into the pattern of so many of the Met\u2019s updatings: It is, almost gesture for gesture, the same as any extra-stale traditional \u201cCarmen,\u201d just dressed up in cutoff jeans and trucker hats instead of flamenco skirts and castanets. Don\u2019t be fooled. The only truly impressive aspect of this \u201cCarmen\u201d is its Carmen: the 27-year-old mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina, in turquoise cowboy boots. Though this icon of the repertory is her first leading role at the Met, she seems unfazed by the pressure, singing with easily penetrating evenness and clarity, never needing to push. Her molten yet agile tone can be confiding one moment and extroverted the next, and she moves with magnetic naturalness onstage. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Putin of Russia says his country will continue targeting Ukrainian cities in retaliation for a deadly attack on the city of Belgorod on Saturday. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia vowed on Monday to continue missile strikes on Ukrainian cities, in retaliation for what he called a \u201cterror\u201d attack on the Russian city of Belgorod last week. \u201cThey want to scare us, to create a certain uncertainty inside the country,\u201d Mr. Putin said during a televised meeting with the veterans of the war in Ukraine. \u201cFrom our side, we will build up the strikes.\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s rare public comments about an attack on the Russian territory comes as his armed forces in recent days have pummeled Ukrainian cities with some of the largest rocket strikes since the start of the invasion, and as both sides look for ways to break a stalemate on the battlefield. The cycle of strikes and retaliation is raising fears of escalating civilian casualties in the conflict, which began in February 2022. On Saturday, Ukraine appeared to have struck back, bombarding Belgorod in an attack that has killed at least 22 people and injured nearly 110 others. It was the deadliest single assault against a Russian city since the start of the war. The Ukrainian government did not comment publicly on the Belgorod attack, as is usually its policy when Russian territory is hit. But an official from Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the strike had been in response to Russia\u2019s massive and deadly air assault against Ukrainian cities on Friday, and that only military facilities had been targeted.

Pope Francis used his New Year\u2019s Day address to highlight concern over the worsening situation of the Roman Catholic Church in Nicaragua as a result of a protracted crackdown by the government of President Daniel Ortega, which has detained clerics, expelled missionaries, closed Catholic radio stations and limited religious celebrations. Speaking to the faithful gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square for the traditional New Year\u2019s Angelus prayer and blessing, Francis said he was \u201cfollowing with concern what is happening in Nicaragua, where bishops and priests have been deprived of their freedom.\u201d He expressed his \u201ccloseness in prayer to them, their families and the entire church in the country,\u201d and called on all Catholics to \u201cpray insistently\u201d to find \u201ca path of dialogue to overcome difficulties.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s pray for Nicaragua today,\u201d Francis said. Vatican News reported on Monday that at least 14 priests, two seminarians and a bishop had been arrested in recent days in Nicaragua, and that the country\u2019s top church leader, Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, had expressed his closeness \u201cto the families and communities who are without their priests at this time.\u201d  Since 2018, as Mr. Ortega has increasingly sidelined political opponents from all walks of life, detaining many and suppressing civic rights, the country\u2019s Catholic leaders remained among the only independent voices of dissent. Gianni La Bella, a professor of contemporary history at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, said in a 2022 interview that since 2018, there had been dozens of attacks of various kinds against the church and its institutions, a sign that the Ortega government perceived the \u201cChurch as an obstacle,\u201d as the \u201conly beacon that can shed light on the conditions of the people in Nicaragua.\u201d We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Ron last filled out a financial aid form in 1992. He\u2019s out of practice. Since 2020, when Congress ordered up simplification of the federal financial aid system, the U.S. Department of Education has faced the complex task of actually making the changes to the ever-important formula for determining who gets what. Grants and loans hinge on the inputs and outputs of the dreaded FAFSA form, which is normally available on Oct. 1. The new form was supposed to debut in 2023, but the department toiled away on it long past October, through November and into December. The government promised to fling the digital doors open by the end of December. My big kid is going to college this fall, so I spent Sunday afternoon and evening trying to access the site and complete the form. Completion proved elusive. Here\u2019s what happened. I began around 2 p.m., and the FAFSA (short for Free Application for Federal Student Aid) website greeted me ominously: \u201cThe FAFSA form is available periodically while we monitor site performance and update the form to provide you with a better experience.\u201d It wasn\u2019t available then, or in the 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 p.m. hours.

The quake disrupted electricity and phone service, and initially raised fears of a tsunami. Reporting from Tokyo A powerful earthquake struck western Japan on Monday, triggering tsunami warnings and evacuation orders, trapping people under collapsed buildings and disrupting electricity and mobile phone services in Ishikawa Prefecture, the epicenter of the quake, the Japanese authorities said. Initial reports suggested the quake did not cause the major tsunami waves or fatalities that had initially been feared, but officials cautioned about the possibility that major aftershocks could occur over the next week, and particularly in the next few days. The quake struck the Noto Peninsula around 4:10 p.m. and had a magnitude of 7.6 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. At least six people died in Ishikawa Prefecture as a result of the quake, the police said. It was much weaker than the 8.9 magnitude earthquake that struck Japan in 2011, causing a tsunami that killed thousands and led to a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima power plant. Officials in the city of Ishikawa said they were overwhelmed by the number of people calling for help, with one fire station there receiving more than 50 calls reporting collapsed buildings, NHK reported.

  "2025-04-26_220829_1": "Migrants, sent mostly from Texas, arrived at train stops outside New York City over the weekend to sidestep a new order limiting how they arrive. Hundreds of migrants bound for New York City took a detour in New Jersey over the holiday weekend, in an apparent attempt to bypass a city order that seeks to limit the chaotic flow of arrivals. Since Saturday, 13 buses from Texas and Louisiana carrying about 450 migrants have arrived in New Jersey, including a bus that arrived early Monday in Jersey City, according to Steve Fulop, the city\u2019s mayor. Other stops included New Jersey Transit hubs in Secaucus, Fanwood, Edison and Trenton. The surge in New Jersey arrivals appears to be an end-run around an emergency executive order last week by New York City\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams, requiring charter bus companies to provide 32 hours\u2019 advance notice of the arrival of migrants and restricting the times of day when they can be dropped off. \u201cThey\u2019re using New Jersey essentially as a bus stop to circumvent the limits on buses that can arrive in New York,\u201d Mr. Fulop said, adding that he is not yet concerned about the migrants\u2019 passage through the state. The buses \u2014 mostly from Texas, but at least one from Louisiana \u2014 had chaperones who assisted migrants in transferring to trains and buses heading into New York City. The office of Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, said that while one of the bus companies was based in the state, the migrants aboard the bus came from Texas, and that their office was not involved.

Israel\u2019s Supreme Court narrowly struck down a law proposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that was meant to limit the court\u2019s own powers. The momentous ruling, which was decided by a majority of eight judges to seven, could ignite a constitutional crisis. Here\u2019s the latest. Members of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party said the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was \u201cin opposition to the nation\u2019s desire for unity, especially in a time of war.\u201d They slammed the court for ruling on the issue while Israeli soldiers were \u201cfighting and endangering themselves in battle.\u201d The decision is likely to rekindle the grave domestic crisis that began a year ago over the right-wing government\u2019s judicial overhaul plan, which led to mass protests that brought the country to a near standstill at times. It heralds a potential showdown between the court and the ruling coalition that could fundamentally reshape Israeli democracy. Background: The law would have barred judges from using the legal concept of \u201creasonableness\u201d to overrule decisions made by lawmakers and ministers. In a country that has one house of Parliament, no formal written constitution and a largely ceremonial president, many people view the Supreme Court as the only bulwark against government power. The government argued that \u201creasonableness\u201d was ill-defined and subjective. In Gaza: Israel announced that it would begin withdrawing several thousand troops from Gaza, at least temporarily. The military emphasized that the move did not indicate any compromise of Israel\u2019s intention to continue fighting, or heeding American requests to scale back. The fighting remains intense. Half of Gaza\u2019s population of about 2.2 million is at risk of starvation and 90 percent say that they regularly go without food for a whole day, according to the U.N.

Isabel Kershner and Aaron Boxerman reported from Jerusalem, and Thomas Fuller from San Francisco. Israel\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday struck down a law limiting its own powers, a momentous step in the legal and political crisis that gripped the country before the war with Hamas, and pitted the court against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government. The court\u2019s 8-7 ruling has the potential to throw Israel\u2019s national emergency government, formed after the Oct. 7 attacks, into disarray and reignite the grave domestic turmoil that began a year ago over the Netanyahu government\u2019s judicial overhaul plan. Mass protests brought the country to a near-standstill at times, in one of the deepest political upheavals Israel had faced in its 75 years, and led to warnings of possible civil war. The court, sitting with a full panel of all 15 of its justices for the first time in its history, rejected the law passed by Parliament in July that barred judges from using a particular legal standard to overrule decisions made by government ministers. The decision comes at a precarious time for Israel, deeply engaged in a brutal war in Gaza and under nearly daily rocket fire from Iranian-backed militants along its northern border. It is seeking to project an image of strength to its enemies but has been shaken by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led surprise attack, by a shrinking economy, and by the alarm and pressure from its closest allies over the deaths of thousands of civilians in Gaza. The much-anticipated decision did not come as a total surprise to Israelis. A television station last week reported on a leaked draft of the ruling. But it heralds a potential showdown that could fundamentally reshape Israeli democracy, pitting the power of the government against that of the judiciary.

The eight Israeli justices who struck down a key part of the judicial overhaul on Monday argued that they had little choice given the law\u2019s potential danger to Israeli democracy. On the other side were seven dissenting justices who saw overreach in the decision to annul a law curbing the judges\u2019 ability to use \u201creasonableness\u201d as a legal standard. Each justice wrote an opinion, with the full decision topping 250,000 words. The ruling capped a landmark case in Israeli jurisprudence. For the first time in Israeli history, the Supreme Court has struck down a quasi-constitutional Basic Law. The justices, led by departing Chief Justice Esther Hayut, argued that the standard of reasonableness was a key tool for judges to protect against arbitrary government overreach, particularly in Israel, which lacks a formal constitution. In her opinion, Justice Hayut said the law curbing the judges\u2019 ability to use reasonableness as a legal standard left the public with little protection from arbitrary government policies or politically motivated decisions to hire or fire civil servants. \u201cGiven the fragile, lacking system of checks and balances that exists in Israel, the total cancellation of judicial review on the reasonableness of government and ministerial decisions renders meaningless a substantial part of the role of the court in defending the individual and the public interest,\u201d Justice Hayut wrote.

She was 90. Her death was confirmed by Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Fine Arts and its National Theater Company, which did not say where she died. The National Theater Company described Ms. Murgu\u00eda on social media as \u201cone of Mexico\u2019s greatest actresses.\u201d In a statement, Lucina Jim\u00e9nez L\u00f3pez, the director of the National Institute of Fine Arts, described her career as one that \u201cmarked an entire era.\u201d  In the 2017 film \u201cCoco,\u201d made by Disney\u2019s Pixar Animation Studios, Ms. Murgu\u00eda plays the key role of Mama Coco, the great-grandmother of a boy, the protagonist Miguel, who finds himself in the land of the dead on a journey to uncover his family\u2019s history. At the emotional climax of the film, Miguel and Mama Coco sing the song \u201cRemember Me\u201d together. The movie, which is built around the Mexican holiday of the Day of the Dead, was celebrated for its portrayal of Mexican culture and its handling of weighty subjects like death in a children\u2019s movie. It won best animated feature and best original song, for \u201cRemember Me,\u201d at the 2018 Oscars. \u201cCoco\u201d introduced Ms. Murgu\u00eda to a global audience, but she was well-known in Mexico long before. She was born on Dec. 8, 1933, in Mexico City. She studied acting at Mexico\u2019s National School of Theater Arts and made her debut in 1954 in the play \u201cTrial By Fire.\u201d Her first screen role was in the 1964 film \u201cTransit.\u201d She would go on to appear in more than 70 plays and 90 films, working with some of Mexico\u2019s best filmmakers.

  "2025-04-26_235599_1": "the 6-day energy challenge Today\u2019s challenge is playful but has serious benefits. This is Day 2 of the 6-Day Energy Challenge. To start at the beginning, click here. When you\u2019re wiped out, getting up and moving might sound like a real drag. But the less active we are during the day, the more fatigued we feel. Today\u2019s challenge is a playful, slightly silly three-minute exercise. Why is this a crucial part of an energy challenge? Because short bursts of movement can help reduce fatigue, relieve stress and improve your mood. As soon as you start, your heart rate goes up, increasing the supply of oxygen to your muscles and brain, said Margaret Rice, a professor of neurosurgery, neuroscience and physiology at the N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine. This rush, she said, might \u201chelp you feel more alert for at least a little while afterward.\u201d She also said that dopamine \u2014 a hormone involved in pleasure, alertness and motivation \u2014 likely increases within those three minutes of movement. Which might explain why you may feel more focused and fired up when you\u2019re finished. A little movement can provide health benefits beyond the energy boost, too. In a 2022 study of over 25,000 British adults, researchers found that those who did a total of three minutes of vigorous movement each day had lower mortality and risk for cardiovascular disease than those who didn\u2019t. Ready to start moving? You won\u2019t need much more than your imagination. Over the course of three minutes, you\u2019ll imitate a boxer, a ballerina, a tennis player, a basketball player, a runner, and, to cool down, a yoga practitioner. For over two decades, Kelly McGonigal, a health psychologist, lecturer at Stanford University and author of \u201cThe Joy of Movement,\u201d has also been an exercise instructor \u2014 and this activity, she said, is a crowd-pleaser. It\u2019s fun, it can be adapted for all abilities and you can wear your regular clothes. Dr. McGonigal suggested doing this exercise first thing, to get your day off to an energetic start. But really you can do it anytime you have three minutes and need a lift. First, find a place where you can move around comfortably. Then run through each of the following for 30 seconds \u2014 for three minutes in total. (You can use the animated timer below: It will show you the next movement when it\u2019s time to switch.) When you\u2019re ready, start doing the following activities. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it, just do it,\u201d Dr. McGonigal said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this wrong.\u201d Here are a few suggested moves to get you started: Boxing. Throw some jabs, pretend you\u2019re hitting a heavy bag, or alternate between fast and slow punches. Ballet. Raise your arms above your head to form a circle. Stretch each leg forward and point your toes. Stand on tiptoe and come back down. Do a pirouette or a leap. Tennis. Try a backhand and forehand swing. Bounce on your heels and return a volley. Throw a \u201cball\u201d into the air and crush a serve. Basketball. Dribble the \u201cball,\u201d take a shot or jump into the air and block an imaginary opponent. Running. Jog in place, pumping and swinging your arms, or throw your hands in the air and sail through the finish line (victory dance optional). Yoga. Assume any pose or posture that makes you feel grounded, such as standing in \u201cmountain\u201d pose with your hands on your heart. At the end of the three minutes, notice how you feel. Is your heart rate up? Are you breathing more deeply? Do you have more energy? Did your mood lift a little? I field-tested this with three generations of people, including my neighbor who is in kindergarten, my teenage nephew and my 81-year-old father. My dad balked at first, but when we began \u201cboxing,\u201d he couldn\u2019t resist joining in and demonstrating an uppercut punch. During the basketball segment, my nephew crowed that he was blocking my \u201cjump shot.\u201d By the end, they were all laughing \u2014 and energized.

Reporting from Seoul Lee Jae-myung, the leader of South Korea\u2019s main opposition party, was stabbed in the neck on Tuesday morning by a man who approached him asking for his autograph, the police said. Mr. Lee, 59, the leader of the liberal Democratic Party, was making his way through a crowd in the port city of Busan when he was attacked, according to the police and live-streamed TV footage of the incident. He had just finished taking questions from journalists after touring the site of a planned airport. The police in Busan said the assailant, a 66-year-old man, had been detained and was under investigation for a possible charge of attempted murder. But they did not provide details about Mr. Lee\u2019s condition or the motives of the attacker, who they said had used a knife with a five-inch blade. Mr. Lee was bleeding from the neck before being taken away in an ambulance, according to news reports and photos from the scene. He was taken to a hospital in Busan, then flown to Seoul by helicopter for treatment at Seoul National University Hospital. Mr. Lee was conscious and recovering from a two-hour-long surgery to remove blood clots and patch up a damaged jugular vein in his neck, Kwon Chilseung, a spokesman for his party, said during a news briefing at the hospital on Tuesday evening. \u201cIt was a close call because it was not an artery, but a vein\u201d that was stabbed, said Jung Chungrae, a senior member of the Democratic Party, citing doctors.

  "2025-04-26_947273_1": "wordplay, the crossword column Jeffrey Martinovic\u2019s crossword cancels itself out. Jump to: Today\u2019s Theme | Tricky Clues TUESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Humor, in the estimation of some of the earliest philosophers, is a reaction to perceived incongruity: Aristotle wrote that a humorous effect is produced when \u201cthe word which comes is not what the hearer imagined.\u201d This is a fairly dry assessment of what makes for good comedy, but it\u2019s the theory that came to mind as I was solving today\u2019s crossword puzzle, constructed by Jeffrey Martinovic. The game of opposites in Mr. Martinovic\u2019s grid asks us to hear common words and phrases in a different way from what we might have imagined. It scrambled my brain a little, and I loved it. Shall we bend an ear together? A 15-letter phrase describing \u201cSome grammatical no-nos,\u201d at 38-Across, doubles as \u201ca description of four pairs of answers in this puzzle.\u201d As a reformed stickler, I know there are endless ways to make mistakes in English \u2014 things \u201cup with which I will not put,\u201d as some say (or don\u2019t). Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of themed entries first and see if we can make them do a little legwork for us. According to a pair of clues, \u201cCease fighting\u201d (16A) is purported to be the opposite of a \u201cSimple exercise\u201d (61A) and vice versa. Well, let\u2019s see: How is an order to STAND DOWN the opposite of a SIT-UP? If we split the expressions, we see that STAND is the opposite of SIT, and DOWN is the opposite of UP. In a way, then, these are neat opposites. Here\u2019s another: To \u201cCut communications\u201d (25A) is to GO DARK, which is somehow the opposite of a \u201cTraffic regulator\u201d (63A). Any guesses? Go for opposites: STOPLIGHT. These are DOUBLE NEGATIVES (38A) \u2014 \u201cgrammatical no-nos\u201d in a different context \u2014 interpreted as such because they are pairs of words that negate each other. 15A. I used my crossings to figure out who \u201cOne living south of the Sooner State\u201d might be since I didn\u2019t know what or where the Sooner State was. It\u2019s the state of Oklahoma, south of which you\u2019d find a TEXAN or two. (Sooners were so called because they raced into the territory before the designated starting time for a land run in 1889.) 34A. Now, this was clever. The answer to a \u201cPlace to find gold \u2026 that\u2019s not yours?\u201d is MINE. This confused me at first \u2014 how could the entry be MINE when the clue explicitly claimed that it wasn\u2019t? Then I noticed the question mark at the end of the clue, which indicates a twist in its interpretation: \u201cYours\u201d should be read as a word asking for its opposite \u2014 thus, MINE. 67A. You\u2019re unlikely to find a \u201cPromotional event at a dealership\u201d called a SELL-A-THON, but the ubiquity of one oft-memed sale with a similar name makes this entry doable, if a bit stretchy. 7D. \u201cCoke vs. Pepsi\u201d is an example of an AD WAR. I won\u2019t choose sides here \u2014 but I will freely admit that I prefer fountain soda to the canned variety, any day. 30D. RIGAMAROLE is such a marvelous word for an \u201cAnnoying process\u201d that just thinking about it relieves part of my annoyance. 52D. What makes this \u201cParty person?\u201d fun to be around may surprise you: The entry is VOTER. 58D. AGHA is a \u201cTurkish title of respect\u201d that means \u201cruler\u201d or \u201celder brother.\u201d Happy New Year! Glad to be back in The New York Times so soon.The genesis of this puzzle came while I was studying for exams last April. So many great ideas come at the most random times. I noticed that \u201cHell, yes\u201d and \u201cHeavens, no\u201d were two-word phrases made up of pairs of opposites, and a theme idea was born. A quick search turned up DOUBLE NEGATIVES, and I knew I had to go ahead with the puzzle. Dozens of iterations later, this was the one arrangement that finally fell into place.Here are a few amusing pairs I found that didn\u2019t make the final cut: meltdown/freeze up, in front/outback, first day/last night, uprise/downfall, stop short/go long.

Maine\u2019s secretary of state was the victim of a \u201cswatting\u201d call to her home, the authorities said, the latest politician to be targeted in recent weeks by people reporting fake crimes to the police, hoping to provoke heavily armed responses. A hoax call was placed on Friday night, just a day after the secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, barred Donald J. Trump from the state\u2019s ballot, a politically fraught decision that drew criticism from Republicans across the country. The state police said that in the call, a man claimed to have broken into Ms. Bellows\u2019s home in Manchester, just outside the capital city of Augusta. State troopers searched the residence, but did not find anything suspicious. Ms. Bellows was not home at the time, the authorities said. In a statement, the state police said that the incident was under investigation and that officials were \u201cworking with our law enforcement partners to provide special attention to any and all appropriate locations.\u201d No arrests have been made.

Workers at a wholesale market in New Delhi.Credit...Rebecca Conway for The New York Times Reporting from New Delhi India\u2019s economy is booming. Stock prices are through the roof, among the best performing in the world. The government\u2019s investment in airports, bridges and roads, and clean-energy infrastructure is visible almost everywhere. India\u2019s total output, or gross domestic product, is expected to increase 6 percent this year \u2014 faster than the United States or China. But there\u2019s a hitch: Investment by Indian companies is not keeping pace. The money that companies put into the future of their businesses, for things like new machines and factories, is stagnant. As a fraction of India\u2019s economy, it is shrinking. And while money is flying into India\u2019s stock markets, long-term investment from overseas has been declining. Green and red lights are flashing at the same time. At some point soon, the government will need to reduce its extraordinary spending, which could weigh on the economy if private sector money doesn\u2019t pick up. No one expects India to stop growing, but a rise of 6 percent is not enough to meet India\u2019s ambitions. Its population, now the world\u2019s biggest, is growing. Its government has set a national goal of catching up to China and becoming a developed nation by 2047. That kind of leap will require sustained growth closer to 8 or 9 percent a year, most economists say. Note: Rolling 12-month total Source: Reserve Bank of India The missing investment could also present a challenge for Narendra Modi, the prime minister since 2014, who has concentrated on making India an easier place for foreign and Indian companies to do business.

In a momentous 8-to-7 ruling that could ignite a constitutional crisis, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court struck down a law passed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government in July to limit the court\u2019s own powers. The law would have barred judges from overruling decisions made by government ministers. Read the latest news. The decision is likely to rekindle the grave domestic situation that began a year ago over the government\u2019s judicial overhaul plan \u2014 which sparked mass protests that brought the country to a near standstill at times \u2014 even as Israel is at war in Gaza.

In a country that has one house of Parliament, no formal written constitution and a largely ceremonial president, many defenders of Israel\u2019s liberal democracy view the Supreme Court as the only bulwark against government power. Background: Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in Israel\u2019s history, has argued that the Supreme Court has overreached its authority and subverted the will of the voters and the function of the elected government.

Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Berlin. Russian missiles and drones hammered Kyiv on Tuesday morning, officials said, in a large-scale attack on the Ukrainian capital and other cities that killed at least five people and injured nearly 130 others, a day after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia promised to retaliate for a Ukrainian assault on a Russian city. The barrage \u2014 which the Ukrainian Air Force said involved about 100 missiles, including hypersonic weapons that fly at several times the speed of sound \u2014 was the latest in an escalating cycle of air assaults between the two countries, as both sides look for ways to inflict damage away from the largely deadlocked front line. Moscow claimed that Ukraine retaliated hours later on Tuesday, firing at least eight missiles on the Russian city of Belgorod. The attack killed one civilian and injured four others, according to the local governor. Later in the day, a strike hit the nearby town of Shebekino, the governor said, damaging an administrative building but causing no injuries. The recent strikes against Ukraine may also be the start of another Russian air campaign against critical infrastructure. The Ukrainian authorities had warned for months that Russia was stockpiling high-precision missiles to pound cities once the weather turned cold in a repeat of last year\u2019s bombing campaign. Experts believe that strategy is aimed at diminishing Ukrainian morale and weakening its military and industrial capacities. Both sides have improved their air defenses in the past year, but they have also expanded their military capacity to hit targets away from the front lines. And as the past week\u2019s cycle of strikes and counter-strikes escalates, Moscow and Kyiv are showing growing readiness to deploy these capabilities.

  "2025-04-26_155206_1": "In April, people across North America will be able to gaze at a stunning total eclipse. And astronauts may get closer to that promised moon landing. Michael Roston has been producing The Times Space and Astronomy Calendar since 2017. India landed a robot on the moon and NASA brought pieces of an asteroid back to Earth to study. A green comet illuminated night skies and a \u201cring of fire\u201d eclipse captivated spectators from Oregon to Brazil. SpaceX launched nearly 100 rockets, and Japan and Europe put powerful new space telescopes into orbit. For space and astronomy lovers, these were some of the biggest events of 2023. The year ahead promises even more memorable happenings on launchpads, in orbit and around the solar system. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect in 2024. The New York Times will provide updates on these and other events in an interactive Space and Astronomy Calendar that you can sign up for at NYTimes.com/spacecalendar. NASA wants to put American astronauts on the moon\u2019s surface in the years ahead with the Artemis III mission. Before that can happen, though, many things have to go right, and two of the most important are scheduled for 2024. The first is the Artemis II mission. NASA introduced the four astronauts of Artemis II last year. As soon as November, the four could travel around the moon and back.

  "2025-04-26_561498_1": "A lawsuit brought by New York\u2019s attorney general against Wayne LaPierre and three other N.R.A. insiders accuses the gun rights group of decades of corruption. Danny Hakim reported from New York. Update: Wayne LaPierre announced that he would resign from the N.R.A. For decades, Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association\u2019s longtime leader, has been a survivor. He has endured waves of palace intrigue, corruption scandals and embarrassing revelations, including leaked video that captured his inability to shoot an elephant at point-blank range while on a safari. But now, Mr. LaPierre, 74, faces his gravest challenge, as a legal showdown with New York\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, goes to trial in a Manhattan courtroom. Ms. James, in a lawsuit filed amid an abrupt effort by the N.R.A. to clean up its practices, seeks to oust him from the group after reports of corruption and mismanagement. Much has changed since Ms. James began investigating the N.R.A. four years ago. The organization, long a lobbying juggernaut, is a kind of ghost ship. After closing its media arm, NRATV, in 2019, it has largely lost its voice, and Mr. LaPierre rarely makes public pronouncements. Membership has plummeted to 4.2 million from nearly six million five years ago. Revenue is down 44 percent since 2016, according to its internal audits, and legal costs have soared to tens of millions a year. When the N.R.A. filed for bankruptcy in Texas nearly three years ago, the step was part of a strategy to move to the state amid the New York investigation. But a Texas judge dismissed the case, saying the N.R.A. was using the filing \u201cto address a regulatory enforcement problem, not a financial one.\u201d Now, longtime insiders say, the organization may be reaching a point where a legitimate bankruptcy filing is necessary. Even with the N.R.A. moribund, Mr. LaPierre\u2019s legacy as a lobbyist, if not as a marksman, remains intact. The gun rights movement has become a bulwark of red state politics during his more than three decades at the group\u2019s helm. In recent years, significant federal gun control measures have been a nonstarter for Republicans despite a proliferation of mass shootings. Mr. LaPierre is among four defendants in the suit brought by Ms. James in 2020. Others include John Frazer, the N.R.A.\u2019s general counsel, and Wilson Phillips, a former finance chief. The fourth defendant, Joshua Powell, was the organization\u2019s second-in-command for a time, but later turned against it and even called for universal background checks for those buying guns and so-called red flag laws that allow the police to seize firearms from people deemed dangerous. An earlier version of this article misstated John Frazer\u2019s role with the National Rifle Association. He is the organization\u2019s general counsel; he is not its former general counsel. An earlier version of this article misidentified the year when State Supreme Court Justice Joel M. Cohen rejected the effort by New York\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, to shut down the N.R.A. It was 2022, not last year. When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

  "2025-04-26_960910_1": "Some of the most contentious issues in the country will dominate the agendas of state legislatures returning to work in the coming days and weeks. As Americans have engaged in fierce disagreement over gender expression and sexual orientation, the costs and reach of racism, and the danger and opportunity presented by rapid technological advancement, state legislatures have been one of the most visible and influential arenas for these debates. It will probably be no different in 2024. Lawmakers in dozens of states will soon be returning to work, weighing in on some of the most divisive issues confronting the country, including access to transition-related care for young transgender people, abortion and gun rights. Lawmakers will also consider new regulations on artificial intelligence, a digital frontier that security experts have described as a serious potential threat \u2014 and one where state lawmakers could play a vital role by adopting safeguards that could be a model for the federal government to follow. \u201cConsensus has yet to emerge, but Congress can look to state legislatures \u2014 often referred to as the laboratories of democracy \u2014 for inspiration regarding how to address the opportunities and challenges posed by A.I.,\u201d said a report published in November from the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and poverty think tank. Several states, including Florida, South Carolina and New Hampshire, are considering legislation that would govern the use of artificial intelligence in political advertising, particularly \u201cdeepfake\u201d technology, which could enable the voice and likeness of a candidate to be co-opted and used in malicious ways.

But five crew members on a Japanese Coast Guard plane that collided with it were killed. Reporting from Tokyo and Okayama in Japan As flight attendants yelled, urging passengers to evacuate, an eerie orange glow burned outside the windows of Japan Airlines Flight 516. The harrowing scene was caught on video from inside the plane, which collided with a Japanese Coast Guard aircraft as it was landing on Tuesday in Tokyo. Through skill and luck \u2014 one aviation expert called it \u201ca miraculous job\u201d \u2014 the flight crew of the Japan Airlines plane evacuated all 367 passengers and 12 crew members safely at Haneda Airport near Tokyo Bay, according to Japan\u2019s transport minister, Tetsuo Saito. But five Coast Guard members, who had been headed to help with the earthquake relief in Western Japan, were killed, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said during a news conference. NHK, the public broadcaster later said 14 people had been injured on the passenger plane. \u201cThe root cause of this accident is not known yet,\u201d Mr. Saito said at a news briefing, adding that the country\u2019s transport safety board and other agencies would work to determine what had happened. Video aired by NHK shows a fireball streaking across the tarmac as the plane touched down. As frightening as that looked from outside the plane, it was even scarier inside, said Anton Deibe, a 17-year-old Swede who was on the plane with his family, as quoted in the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.

  "2025-04-26_811306_1": "What to Watch As the industry continues to embrace computer-generated work, some audiences struggle to accept the change. The filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, a founder of the animation house Studio Ghibli, is one of the last practitioners of hand-drawn animation. His new coming-of-age fantasy, \u201cThe Boy and the Heron,\u201d has been praised for a style that seems like a relic from the past. The IndieWire critic David Ehrlich called it \u201camong the most beautiful movies ever drawn,\u201d a much-needed salve \u201cafter a decade of \u2018Minions\u2019\u201d; it\u2019s also a likely Oscar contender. But while much of \u201cThe Boy and the Heron\u201d was illustrated with pencil and paint on paper, the movie \u2014 like virtually every modern anime film \u2014 makes extensive use of computer animation, including digital compositing and visual effects. The classical, naturalistic style of the film does not call attention to such techniques, though they were a fundamental part of its design and production. They\u2019re most evident in small flourishes: the vibrant flicker of a flame, the swirling flight of an arrow. Atsushi Okui, director of animation photography on \u201cThe Boy and the Heron\u201d and a longtime Studio Ghibli cinematographer, said in an interview that the studio regards C.G.I. as \u201ca complementary tool in graphic production that puts hand-drawn 2-D animation as its principal axis.\u201d Many recent high-profile anime movies have embraced computer-generated work more blatantly, in some cases forgoing the 2-D style entirely. \u201cThe First Slam Dunk,\u201d released in the United States in July, and \u201cDragon Ball Super: Super Hero\u201d (2022) were animated in a style known as 3DCG anime, which combines the hard outlines and flat planes of traditional 2-D animation with 3-D models and movement. The result looks a bit like a video game. These are extreme cases of a shift that\u2019s been occurring industrywide. In different ways and to varying degrees, all anime has been going digital. The transition has been a box office success: \u201cThe First Slam Dunk\u201d ($152 million and counting) and \u201cDragon Ball Super: Super Hero\u201d ($86 million) have been incredibly lucrative for Toei Animation, and both are among the highest-grossing anime titles of all time.

  "2025-04-26_697685_1": "You don\u2019t need a fancy home gym or a trainer to build an exercise habit. These ideas will get you started. If you have a limitless budget, there is no question that you can get into shape. You can hire top-flight trainers, buy yourself a Peloton or a Tonal smart gym, and then splurge on bikes, kayaks and windsurfing gear. For most of us, though, shelling out thousands of dollars on fitness equipment isn\u2019t practical, especially if you suspect it will end up in a dusty closet once your New Year\u2019s resolution wears off. But here\u2019s a little secret: Getting in shape doesn\u2019t have to cost a fortune. \u201cI can go to the beach for free,\u201d said Milo F. Bryant, a trainer based in San Diego. \u201cI can pick up some hundred-pound rocks and carry them.\u201d Mr. Bryant (who has also been known to push cars for a workout \u2014 he recommended midsize sedans for beginners, only on flat surfaces) said bear crawls are another great, cheap exercise. \u201cYou do bear crawls going down steps, your upper body is dying by the end,\u201d he said. Mr. Bryant noted that he eventually had to start working out at night to avoid all the stares as he lugged rocks around and crawled on steps. But there are plenty of other ways to get a solid workout for less money than a trip to TGI Fridays. There is a reason every good \u201cRocky\u201d movie has a jump rope scene: It\u2019s an incredible workout. A $10 jump rope might be the single best cheap workout tool there is. Try a Tabata-style routine, with 20 seconds on and 10 seconds off, and see if you can go for 10 or 20 minutes. For more upper body work, try weighted ropes, between one half pound and one pound to start out. Those who don\u2019t feel comfortable jumping can let the rope hit the ground and then step over it, said Gwen Gates, a coach at the Logan Health Medical Fitness Center in Kalispell, Mont. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s maybe rehabbing an injury,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s going to get your heart rate up, because you\u2019re taking your knees up.\u201d Battle ropes are another great way to work the arms and get some cardio with little risk of injury. And while most tend to start at $50, nothing is stopping you from making one with supplies from the hardware store. If you want to do bench presses, dead lifts and curls but don\u2019t have space or the budget for barbells, consider using exercise bands, like the ones physical therapists often use. A full set shouldn\u2019t cost more than $20 and the only limit to their uses is your imagination.  Mr. Bryant likes to put a set around his ankles or knees, then put his hands on the floor with another band around his wrists, and walk sideways, stretching them as he goes. \u201cI start everybody off with the yellows because the yellows are typically the easiest ones,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou want to be able to move.\u201d Kettlebell workouts are popular these days, but the weights tend to be pricey. So Brad Roy, who works with Ms. Gates and is the editor of the American College of Sports Medicine\u2019s Health & Fitness Journal, suggested medicine balls instead. They can be used in similarly dynamic moves and start around $20, though it\u2019s important to get instruction from a trainer to avoid injury. Ms. Gates suggested picking an amount of weight that you can hold in front of you during a squat. Once you feel comfortable with that, try squatting while holding the ball above your head. Want to really get back to basics? Try an approach that dates back to the Pleistocene. What our ancestors called \u201cwalking or running with weight on your back,\u201d and what we now call rucking, is one of the easiest ways to build strength, stamina and muscular endurance while taking the dog for a stroll or buying a loaf of bread. Fancy rucking backpacks start at around $100, but you can achieve the same thing by just putting a few books or water bottles in whatever backpack you already have. If you happen to find some pull-up bars or other exercise tools on your walk, leave the backpack on while you use them. If not, find a playground. Mr. Bryant said there are hundreds of exercises you can do on a playground, from step-ups to tricep dips. If you don\u2019t have a playground, he said, try walking backward up a slope. This will target your quads, and small studies suggest it may improve balance, stability and overall fitness more than walking forward. When you imagine a chiseled athlete, a bird-watcher is probably not the first thing you think of. But you might be surprised. It\u2019s not that bird-watching is harder than normal walking (if anything, it\u2019s slower), but that you end up walking longer when you\u2019re looking to pick up that last warbler for your list. It\u2019s more fun if you have a pair of binoculars, but that\u2019s not a requirement. Don\u2019t like birds? Grab a Frisbee and try some disc golf. With 9,000 courses in the United States, there might be one nearby. Or consider working a shadowboxing routine into your walk. You could also try walking with poles, Dr. Roy suggested. These start at around $25 and make great exercise for the arms and shoulders as you push down on them and propel yourself forward, he said. They\u2019re just as useful on a sidewalk as they are on a trail. Make sure they are adjusted so that your forearms are parallel to the ground and your elbows are at 90-degree angles. For people who are considering walking with a cane, Dr. Roy often recommends trying one or two trekking poles instead, which encourage better posture than leaning over a cane. Lastly, Dr. Roy added, if you want to pick up the pace and you have access to a tennis court, you might try pickleball, which starts at $30 for paddles and balls (though $100 gets you a better set). Among older adults especially, pickleball builds hand-eye coordination and improves balance, to say nothing of the fitness benefits, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an awesome activity.\u201d Erik Vance is a staff editor for The Times\u2019s Well desk, where he focuses on coverage of fitness and a healthy lifestyle.

Aaron and Andr\u00e9 Eanes signed Travis Kelce to their management company when all three of them were still in college.Credit...Amir Hamja/The New York Times In the only recent year in which Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs weren\u2019t playing in the Super Bowl, the N.F.L. star was driving around Los Angeles in early February with his business managers, Andr\u00e9 and Aaron Eanes, marveling at billboards featuring Dwayne Johnson, the actor and entertainer better known as the Rock. \u201cMan, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be as famous as the Rock,\u201d Mr. Kelce said.

In March, he hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d He\u2019s starred in seven national television commercials. The podcast he co-hosts with his brother, Jason, is among the most popular on Spotify.

Credit...Eric Helgas for The New York Times Q: What are the health effects of Dry January? Can cutting back on alcohol for a month have long-term benefits? Champagne, eggnog, mulled wine \u2014 for many, the holiday season is a time for celebration, which typically involves copious amounts of alcohol. So it\u2019s no surprise that an estimated 15 to 19 percent of U.S. adults in recent years have pledged to participate in Dry January, or \u201cDrynuary,\u201d in an effort to atone for their December choices and, hopefully, slightly unpickle their livers. There\u2019s been little research into what, exactly, a month off alcohol can do for your health. And the benefits will depend on how much and how frequently you drank before, said Danielle Dick, a professor and director of the Rutgers Addiction Research Center. But, Dr. Dick added, we do know that alcohol has numerous and varied effects on the body, \u201cso presumably, regardless of how much you drink, you will see improvements across many areas.\u201d If you\u2019re a regular drinker, a sudden change in your habits may make you feel worse at first, not better, said Sara Jo Nixon, a cognitive neuroscientist and director of the Center for Addiction Research and Education at the University of Florida.

  "2025-04-26_9402_1": "What to Read Fiction True to the promise of its title, \u201cThe Storm We Made\u201d kicks up a weather system of epic proportions, ranging from military terror during World War II to domestic warmth. When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE STORM WE MADE, by Vanessa Chan \u201cIsn\u2019t every man a good man and a bad man?\u201d asks Cecily Alcantara, the protagonist of Vanessa Chan\u2019s debut novel, \u201cThe Storm We Made,\u201d which is set against the lead-up to Japan\u2019s invasion and occupation of Malaya (now Malaysia) in World War II. The question, posed by a mother to a general who is scheming to overthrow the British, encapsulates the contradiction woven throughout Chan\u2019s novel. Housewives become spies; saviors become oppressors; unlikely friendships bloom; and young men endure and inflict horrific violence. This is perhaps the book\u2019s greatest power: It makes space for complexity without relinquishing the grip of a good story. \u201cThe Storm We Made\u201d opens in 1945 in Japanese-occupied Malaya where, despite the hard-won downfall of British rule, hopes of a \u201cbetter colonizer\u201d have been dashed. Boys are being forced into labor camps and girls are kidnapped to become comfort women. The threat of losing loved ones becomes reality for the Alcantara family when Cecily\u2019s 15-year-old son, Abel, doesn\u2019t come home. We soon learn, in scenes of increasing brutality, that Japanese soldiers have put him to work on the Burma Railway. As the days progress, the tight knot of the family comes apart. We witness its unraveling through the eyes of Abel\u2019s sisters: Jujube, who works at a teahouse frequented by raucous Japanese soldiers and a soft-spoken Japanese teacher who takes a liking to her, and Jasmin, who escapes despondency at home while secretly playing with her Japanese friend Yuki. Chan reveals how war is experienced in bodies and hearts, breaking down the morale of those who remain. She writes, \u201cWould their family continue to exist in the horrific silence of their present, creaking around like tired apparitions in their own home, weighed down by the footfalls of their sadness?\u201d Interspersed with the siblings\u2019 perspectives are chapters from a decade earlier, exposing the part Cecily chose to play in the Japanese invasion. Her role: stealing intelligence from her husband, a bureaucrat for the British administration, and passing it to General Fujiwara of the Japanese Imperial Army, who woos her with dreams of \u201can Asia for Asians\u201d (and with his toxic charm). Tired of being underestimated, Cecily uses her \u201cinvisibility cloak of femininity\u201d to effect change, consequences be damned. At first, the point of the dual timelines feels uncertain, although it does provide context for Cecily\u2019s guilt about her family\u2019s disintegration. Then the threads converge, forming a braid that proves to be stronger than its individual parts. This is a novel concerned with power \u2014 how it\u2019s given and taken, whom we must align with to get close to it \u2014 and the consuming desire for more. From the cunning general to the tormented son locked in a chicken coop, characters are constantly striving, their destinies driven by the \u201cpersistent gurgle of want.\u201d Chan never shies from the intricacies of this hunger; it eats at Cecily, fostering delusion and inviting humiliation and shame. But simmering beneath all of this is the will to dream \u2014 for the self, the family and the nation. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

HOW TO BE A RENAISSANCE WOMAN: The Untold History of Beauty & Female Creativity, by Jill Burke Shapewear. Stretch mark remedies. Nose jobs. Eyebrow shaping. These things are not just preoccupations of ours, but also concerned the women of the Renaissance. In \u201cHow to Be a Renaissance Woman: The Untold History of Beauty & Female Creativity,\u201d Jill Burke, a professor of Renaissance studies at the University of Edinburgh, brings us a breezy and readable portrait of 16th-century Italy through the lens of beauty standards and practices. One source that inspired the book was Giovanni Marinello\u2019s \u201cThe Ornaments of Ladies,\u201d first published in Venice in 1562, which included 1,400 recipes for face, hair and body. Burke does some of her own translations from Italian and even adapts recipes for those readers interested in trying out their own distilled broad-bean flower water. The 16th century, Burke notes, is a time, like the one we are living through now, when technology and visual culture collided. Developments in single-point perspective, draftsmanship and anatomy all influenced portraiture. And body ideals were changing from the gothic paragon, with narrow shoulders and big hips, to soft hourglasses, preferably complete with pale skin and golden curls. There are plenty of noblewomen in these pages \u2014 their stories are usually the best documented \u2014 but Burke makes an effort to talk about women of many kinds: domestic help, peasants, widows, courtesans and all manner of sex workers.

  "2025-04-26_471732_1": "Farah Stockman Photographs by Cydni Elledge Ms. Stockman, a Michigan-bred member of the editorial board, reported from Detroit. I found it online: a weary, five-bedroom American Foursquare house on a block in Detroit that had seen better days. The blue tarp over the roof didn\u2019t scare me. (It should have.) Neither did the price: $44,000, which would barely purchase a parking space in the Boston area, where I live. The house was not far from where my mother\u2019s aunts stayed in the 1940s, when they moved up from Mississippi to escape Jim Crow. Nor was it far from Motown\u2019s first recording studio \u2014 now a museum \u2014 or Henry Ford Hospital, an enormous complex that was making ambitious plans to expand. I asked my cousin Kristina to check out the house. \u201cI thought it had a lot of potential,\u201d she told me. She noted that a white guy lived across the street \u2014 rare for that part of town. Before I knew it, we owned it, leaky roof and all. The house, which we purchased in 2021 as a family investment, was part of a crazy experiment to see if we could play a role in improving a neighborhood and secure a place for my cousins, who were born in Detroit but were now in danger of being priced out. It\u2019s been more than 10 years since Detroit filed for bankruptcy, and a wave of money has crashed on downtown Detroit. Section 8 apartments have become luxury condos. The greater downtown area now boasts an outdoor ice-skating rink bigger than the one at Rockefeller Center, a James Beard Award-winning patisserie and a state-of-the-art arena where some of the biggest stars in the world perform. Detroit, the great American city that had given birth to the automobile industry and the American middle class, is making a comeback. I confess to being impressed. But my Detroit-born cousins were not. The renaissance is concentrated in seven square miles of a city 20 times that size. New amenities \u2014 like the quaint Qline streetcar \u2014 stop at the edge of downtown and never reach most residents. (My cousin James calls the Qline \u201cthe gentrification-mobile.\u201d) Kristina recalls a 2017 ad for the city, which is majority Black, featuring virtually all white faces. It caused an uproar and was taken down quickly, but as far as she\u2019s concerned, it said the quiet part out loud. As white people have flocked to the most desirable areas of the city, thousands of Black Detroiters have moved away, unable to afford to rent or buy. Worst of all, the megaprojects that are transforming Detroit are being subsidized by tax breaks and sweetheart land deals to billionaires. Many Detroiters feel their taxes are paying for the very forces that are pushing them out. That anger fueled an activist campaign in 2016 that made Detroit the only major American city to pass a community benefits agreement ordinance that requires developers to negotiate a deal with the community for any project that receives significant tax breaks or public land transfers. In other cities, similar but voluntary agreements have been designed to provide something of value for residents who would otherwise be bystanders to big development deals: A guarantee of living wages in Los Angeles, retail spaces for local artisans in Nashville and priority hiring of disadvantaged groups in Birmingham, Ala. But in Detroit, which passed a watered-down version, it\u2019s not clear whether this ordinance can give lifelong Detroiters a bigger stake in the city\u2019s success. I started out optimistic that the city would figure it out. If there\u2019s any city that could do development without displacement, I reasoned, it should be Detroit, which has so many vacant houses. But I didn\u2019t take into account the thorny questions about who Detroit\u2019s comeback is for and what investors owe the people who have been here all this time. It takes more than money to bring a dead house back to life in a struggling neighborhood. It takes a near-religious faith that the effort will be worth it. It wasn\u2019t just the roof that needed replacement on our house. After years of neglect, rot had seeped in. What began as a modest upgrade turned into a gut renovation. After a parade of shoddy contractors, I begged a childhood friend \u2014 a meticulous artisan \u2014 to get us back on track. It felt good to watch him strip out the old knob-and-tube wiring and make what was once crooked straight. But just as we were about to pass our first inspections, he quarreled with a dishonest electrician we\u2019d hired. The electrician sent an ominous text: \u201cWelcome to Detroit.\u201d Hours later, someone smashed through the door and stole my friend\u2019s tools and our hot water heater. The police were reluctant to investigate. \u201cThis is Detroit,\u201d one officer explained, a phrase I heard often that justified why people in Detroit shouldn\u2019t expect much. After the robbery, every idling car felt like a potential threat. I started getting alerts on my phone about assaults and robberies committed nearby. My friend renewed his license to carry a gun for protection. Kristina urged me not to give up. \u201cGod always has a plan,\u201d she said. I counted our blessings: Our next-door neighbor had scared the robbers off, risking his own safety. Several houses near us were getting fixed up. The sounds of hammers and saws filled the air. In August a neighbor told me about the latest megaproject to come to Detroit: a $3 billion medical complex created by Henry Ford Hospital, complete with a research lab the hospital will share with Michigan State University, and more than 600 units of housing that would be built by Tom Gores, the private-equity billionaire who owns the Detroit Pistons. Construction costs are expected to exceed the $2.6 billion annual budget of the city itself. And it was just a mile from our house. Some of my neighbors welcomed the project. Others complained about being colonized. I grew hopeful that it would bring more security and jobs. But Cassandra Floyd, the executive director of the West Grand Boulevard Collaborative, a neighborhood group that was surveying hopes and fears about the project, worried that the benefits would flow to the already affluent, like the developments downtown. A previous agreement with Henry Ford Hospital didn\u2019t live up to expectations, Ms. Floyd said. It focused on jobs. A lot of people got hired. Then a lot lost their jobs. Cynicism set in. Once, she tried to get high school students to draw their dreams for the neighborhood. They refused. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to do anything for us,\u201d one told her. \u201cWe have to do better this time,\u201d she vowed. The group decided to push for funds for home repair and rental assistance for longtime residents, among other requests in the community benefits agreement. In October the community benefits process kicked off with a meeting at a local high school. Jerk chicken was served. From a distance, it looked like local democracy in action. Eighty-three area residents cast ballots for two community representatives who would sit on the committee that would negotiate a benefits package with developers. The West Grand Boulevard Collaborative scored a victory: Two candidates it endorsed won spots on the committee. But democracy it was not. The other seven committee members were appointed by City Council members or the city planning department. The pressure to agree to whatever developers offered would be intense, warned Tonya Myers Phillips, a lawyer with the nonprofit Sugar Law Center who works closely with Ms. Floyd. Ms. Phillips said the city would do its best to limit the developer\u2019s obligations and that developers would try to pass off existing programs or legal obligations as new benefits. She was right. In the final package, uncompensated care for the uninsured makes up a lion\u2019s share of public benefits that developers offered the city, even though the nonprofit hospital is already obligated to provide some of that. Representatives for the hospital and Michigan State University argued that they\u2019re different from the for-profit developers. The project itself \u2014 the creation of a major medical complex in the city \u2014 will be enough of a huge benefit to the community, they said. That made sense. But what about Mr. Gores\u2019s housing units? Did they really deserve the nearly $300 million in tax abatements developers were seeking? In community meetings, the tax break was presented as vital to the project\u2019s success, ensuring a modest 4 percent return. Must be nice, I thought, scratching my head over how to make my own home renovation project break even. Each stage brought new fees and expensive requirements \u2014 $900 for a building permit, $250 to register the house as vacant, $1,100 to bury the electrical line. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so painful,\u201d Ms. Phillips said. The committee had asked for tens of millions of dollars for rental assistance and home repair. Developers offered just $2.5 million \u2014 an amount that would be credited against any fines developers might incur for failing to hire enough Detroiters on the construction site, a requirement imposed by the city. The committee had requested at least $3 million for grants to community groups. Developers agreed to just $300,000 to be distributed over 15 years. That comes to just $20,000 a year, to be divided among community groups in an area that\u2019s home to thousands. It was a stunningly small amount, all the more so when you consider that Henry Ford Hospital employees a few years ago received $20,000 incentives to buy houses in the city. The message seemed clear: The powers that be bent over backward to bring new people in but not to help those already here. Joanne Adams, a West Grand Boulevard Collaborative member who served on the negotiating committee, was so insulted by the developers\u2019 offer that she spoke out against it, calling it \u201ctokenism.\u201d Others agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of giving our welfare checks to billionaires,\u201d one woman said at a public meeting. But the committee passed it. The City Council will probably pass it, too, when the vote comes up this month. This process only works if city officials push developers for the best possible deal, Julian Gross, a California attorney who negotiated some of the first benefits agreements, told me. In Detroit that doesn\u2019t happen because people think the city \u201cis lucky to get anything,\u201d Dr. Lisa Berglund, a professor of urban planning at Dalhousie University, told me. Antoine Bryant, the city\u2019s director of planning and development, told me that Detroit\u2019s ordinance was a national model and that the Pistons\u2019 \u201cstrong record of providing community benefits and investment in the city of Detroit\u201d should be taken into account when evaluating the deal. I didn\u2019t want to let it go. I wrote to Mr. Gores, asking about the microgrants. Was that a typo? Was there a zero missing? He\u2019s a billionaire. Couldn\u2019t he give more? A spokesman replied that Mr. Gores was not involved in the details but defended the benefits package. \u201cWe are not a team of real estate developers motivated by profit,\u201d he told me in an email. \u201cWe are a group of partners who came together to improve our shared neighborhood in a way that positively impacts the community.\u201d It sounded familiar.

  "2025-04-26_85324_1": "A dinosaur fossil listed for sale in London for $20 million embodies one of the most heated debates in paleontology. Zachary Small reported from London, and Julia Jacobs from New York. When fossil hunters unearthed the remains of a dinosaur from the hills of eastern Montana five years ago, they carried several key characteristics of a Tyrannosaurus rex: a pair of giant legs for walking, a much smaller pair of arms for slashing prey, and a long tail stretching behind it. But unlike a full-grown T. rex, which would be about the size of a city bus, this dinosaur was more like the size of a pickup truck. The specimen, which is now listed for sale for $20 million at an art gallery in London, raises a question that has come to obsess paleontologists: Is it simply a young T. rex who died before reaching maturity, or does it represent a different but related species of dinosaur known as a Nanotyrannus? The dispute has produced reams of scientific research and decades of debate, polarizing paleontologists along the way. Now, with dinosaur fossils increasingly fetching eye-popping prices at auction, the once-esoteric dispute has begun to ripple through auction houses and galleries, where some see the T. rex name as a valuable brand that can more easily command high prices. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately a quite in-the-weeds question of the taxonomy and the classification of one very particular type of dinosaur,\u201d said Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cHowever, it involves T. rex, and the debate always gets a little bit more ferocious when the king of dinosaurs is involved.\u201d On the internet, juvenile T. rex versus Nanotyrannus has become something of a meme, providing fuel for jokes on niche social media channels. (\u201cI won\u2019t believe in Nanotyrannus until it shows up at my own door and devours me,\u201d a paleontology student with the handle \u201cTheDinoBuff\u201d joked recently on the social media site X.)

Instead of Helen Keller, we have Marie Heurtin (impressively played by the deaf actress Ariana Rivoire), 14, who arrives at a rural French convent near Poitiers at the turn of the 20th century. Barely more than a savage, Marie thrashes wildly as her exhausted parents drop her off, her hands secured by leather handcuffs attached to a leash. Her lunatic demeanor teases a livelier, more jagged story, but it\u2019s not to be: Intent on delivering a three-hankie weepie, Mr. Am\u00e9ris slathers on the sentiment with the proficiency that Marie brings to scaling trees \u2014 a talent that would impress even if she were sighted. Taken in hand, quite literally, by Sister Marguerite (Isabelle Carr\u00e9), Marie flails from one mushy eureka moment to another, eventually mastering a hairbrush and \u2014 moments later, it seems \u2014 complex sign language. That\u2019s the cue for her teacher\u2019s lung problems to worsen and for Marie to grapple with abstract concepts like abandonment, but she\u2019ll have plenty of time: Not even our favorite doctor on \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d was afforded the attenuated decline that Sister Marguerite enjoys.

  "2025-04-26_969556_1": "Front Burner A nonalcoholic red wine that can stand up to steak, a new source for a Japanese citrus fruit and more food news. Have you resolved to expand your culinary repertoire in the New Year? Published late last year, \u201cThe Korean Cookbook\u201d by Junghyun Park, the chef at Atomix and others in New York, and Jungyoon Choi, a chef and writer, provides nearly 500 pages of comprehensive illustrated coverage of hansik, or Korean food culture. It surveys history, geography, vocabulary, techniques, ingredients, meal structure and the evolution of Korean food, all for the home cook, starting with fermentation and kimchi, bap (rice) and banchan, the other dishes arrayed on the table to elevate that simple bowl of rice. These include namul (vegetables), wraps, pancakes, broths, stews, dumplings, porridges and sweets. The point is made, repeatedly, that despite the ubiquity of beef in Korean restaurants in the West, notably short ribs, vegetables actually dominate the cuisine. There is a great deal to learn. The 350 recipes do not represent a personal collection but a textbook survey, with some simple treasures like superbly fresh raw fish bibimbap, japchae glass noodles, kimchi fried rice and cucumbers stir-fried with richly marinated beef, all calling for ingredients that are easy to obtain. Others are more challenging, requiring dried jujube, salted shrimp, chrysanthemum leaves and Korean pancake mix. (Possible substitutes are rarely suggested.) And with its focus on regional cooking, the book needs a map for those unfamiliar with Korean geography. \u201cThe Korean Cookbook\u201d by Junghyun Park and Jungyoon Choi, (Phaidon, $54.95). The chef Marco Canora was an early proponent of bone broth with his Brodo shop and the Brodos he sells online and in stores. He started 10 years ago dispensing the broth by the cup like a grandma in an Italian village from a takeout window at his restaurant Hearth, in the East Village. Now, just in time for winter, he has introduced handy single-serving eight-ounce packages of the broths, not needing refrigeration. Heating helps though. There\u2019s a kick to the Deeply Rooted with ginger and turmeric, and the Spicy Nonna with garlic and chile. Basic organic chicken and the original, with poultry and beef bones, are some other varieties; Tuscan Sun with rosemary and lemon, and Tom Yum combining coconut, lime, and chile are coming soon. $5.50 for eight ounces, available in multiples and by subscription, brodo.com.  Forget which came first. The latest arrival on the egg front is not an egg at all, but a yellow vegan plant-based liquid called Every Egg that behaves astonishingly like a whole beaten egg. It\u2019s made by the Every Company, a biotech firm in San Francisco, from protein that is brewed from yeast and replicates egg protein (it\u2019s not for those with egg allergies). It can be beaten with a whisk to thicken it, then added to a pan with some fat and scrambled or rolled into an omelet. The texture and flavor came very close to the real thing in my skillet. (Full disclosure: I used butter.) Though cr\u00e8me anglaise is usually made just with yolks, I used Every Egg (with dairy) for excellent results. At Eleven Madison Park in December, Daniel Humm used it to make a savory sabayon sauce, a custardy chawanmushi, a classic cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and to emulsify a vinaigrette. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty identical to a regular egg,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, a natural product; that\u2019s what attracted me to it.\u201d It contains no fat or cholesterol. Fermentation appears to be the key to this and some other recently introduced animal protein substitutes. Consumers will not find Every Egg in their grocery stores any time soon, but it will be available for restaurants in coming months. The company also has an egg white substitute that it started selling in 2022. Every Egg, everyegg.com.  We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

  "2025-04-26_865331_1": "The state is courting high-tech investments, but a new industrial park may lack enough water. Opponents say piping it from miles away might dry out residential wells. When Indiana officials created a new industrial park to lure huge microchip firms to the state, they picked a nearly 10,000-acre site close to a booming metropolis, a major airport and a university research center. But the area is missing one key ingredient to support the kinds of development the state wants to attract: access to the huge amounts of water that microchip makers might need. Officials floated a plan to pipe in enormous volumes of water from an aquifer about 40 miles away. But the plan raised concerns about straining groundwater supplies at the source, prompting widespread calls to scrap the idea, at least until more studies can be carried out. Last week, state officials said they would do just that, with Gov. Eric Holcomb and other leaders pledging to move on the project only after studies could be completed to ensure any withdrawals are sustainable. \u201cThe data \u2014 yet still to be gathered \u2014 will drive any or all future decisions,\u201d Gov.

  "2025-04-26_889184_1": "What to Watch The designer Holly Waddington breaks down how Emma Stone\u2019s Bella Baxter evolves onscreen, from her childish knickers to her cage-like wedding dress. The designer Holly Waddington had wide latitude in envisioning the costumes for \u201cPoor Things,\u201d Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s mad comedy starring Emma Stone. \u201cThe only brief really was that he didn\u2019t want it to be overtly like a period drama\u201d \u2014 the script is set in the 1880s \u2014 \u201cand he didn\u2019t want it to be overtly like a science fiction film,\u201d Waddington said. In the movie (a Golden Lion winner at the Venice Film Festival and now an Oscar contender), Stone is a scientist\u2019s creation who evolves from a childlike na\u00eff to a sexually and politically liberated woman. The Greek-born director Lanthimos, known for his surrealist vision, gave Waddington only one reference image: a young designer\u2019s take on \u201cinflatable trousers,\u201d Waddington recalled. When puffed up, they \u201ccreated this really exaggerated shape, just incredibly curvaceous.\u201d She worked with other departments, like production design and hair and makeup, to finish the look for Stone\u2019s Bella Baxter, whose life changes on a Grand Tour of cities like Lisbon. A lot snapped into focus when Waddington learned that Bella would have long, jet-black hair; an Egon Schiele painting was Lanthimos\u2019s inspiration for that, she said, and it informed her color palette. Another thing to consider, in a movie with a lot of sex scenes: How the clothes come off. \u201cI had many slightly awkward conversations with Yorgos about it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was asking me, how does she have sex in these? I was probably a bit embarrassed. But he\u2019s not, at all.\u201d Waddington knew her Victoriana; she spent years working in a costume house, specializing in archival ladies fashion. But for this film, she cut loose the corsetry \u2014 a scary prospect at first, she said, because corsets give period clothes their shape \u2014 and mixed eras and materials.

Kyla Scanlon coined \u201cvibe session\u201d last year to describe this gap between perception and economic indicators, trying to describe the sort of general malaise that the public had about the economy despite all of the major indicators about the economy\u2019s health trending upward. And the way that we were talking about the economy as being a vibes session or a vibes-based recession really struck me as being a bit diminutive, frankly, which is that it was diminishing the way that people have this really intuitive sense about the way the world works around them, even if they don\u2019t always have a very sophisticated analysis for understanding why things around them are happening the way that they are in economic terms. And both of those things matter. It really came down to me that what we were really looking at here was that this was a conflict between bad economic storytelling and good economic storytelling. And by bad economic storytelling, I don\u2019t mean economic storytelling about bad economic indicators or about bad economic events. I mean economic storytelling that does not convey what the economic fundamentals actually mean to people. And there\u2019s a difference between giving people the statistics and then putting those statistics in a context that tells people what they can do. One way to get at a good economic story is to say there isn\u2019t a perception gap between the macroeconomic indicators and how people perceive them, but there is a version of the story where both people\u2019s perceptions and the indicators can be true. If you are a consumer today, being a consumer doesn\u2019t feel very good. On one level, there\u2019s a consuming that we have to do to survive. Things like housing, groceries, energy, gas, transportation, all of those things are actually not trending in directions that people find positive. And they have not trickled down for all Americans, even the ones that are maybe nudging in slightly positive directions. In the case of gas prices, for example, are offset by things like the cost of maintaining vehicles or other high transportation costs. Grocery bills at the individual level for people at the grocery store still feel pretty high. Then there\u2019s the consuming that we do to maybe manage all of the rest of that. So one indicator that people talk about the growth of the economy is low unemployment. That means more people are working. And more people are working for higher wages, by the way. More Americans working means there are more Americans living with the day-to-day tradeoff of the costs of going to work. Paying the cost of working looks like traveling to and from work, and it also looks like doing things like managing the cost of your home while you\u2019re working, child care, elder care being the two big ones. You got to have someone to do all that other stuff at home. So no matter how much you might be making or how grateful you may be to not be unemployed, you could be feeling the sort of shock of what it means to be in the paid labor market and its effect on your day-to-day life. The American Rescue Plan in 2021 was, for many Americans, their first experience of the government entering into a really strong relationship with them to help them live their daily lives, right? It made their economic situations tangibly better. So you had things like moratorium eviction stays that allowed more people to be housed. You had an extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit that helped lift millions of people out of poverty, many of them children and young adults. You had stays on student loan repayments. So for a lot of Americans, this was just an expansion of the social safety net. And when those benefits started to expire, Americans saw that pullback of state investment in helping them manage sort of their economic security. And I think you can understand how people would feel more anxious about their ability to navigate the economy without that support when they have such a recent example of what it feels like to have that support. And I think this is why we see such particularly high dissatisfaction numbers across Americans, across income groups, and across racial categories, and age groups. And what this should tell us is that there is a version, then, of economic storytelling that can get at people\u2019s economic anxiety without saying that you\u2019ve all been manipulated by a story that discounts your understanding of the economic indicators. Good economic storytelling tells people that there isn\u2019t someone to blame, but there is someone who is responsible. There is a responsible authority for what you are experiencing. And a version of that story would sound something like this. Look what happens when we invest in America\u2019s middle class and working class. Look what happens when partnerships between your government and your community creates not just investment in individuals and families, but capacity for communities to have the services that those communities need. When we did that for this shining moment, even if that shining moment was in response to global crisis, we lifted millions of Americans out of poverty. We allowed more of women and people of color to enter into the labor market a more equal footing. We were able to open up these avenues of participation for people. We were able to do these things. If you can tell this story that says your anxiety is not misfounded, it is just founded in a version of America that was temporary, but that we can and should shore up, that we shouldn\u2019t be focused on what we have lost with the expirational parts of the American Rescue Plan, but that the American Rescue Plan was a vision for what could happen. When we forget that storytelling piece, we leave open a lot of space for a lot of nefarious ideas about the economy. And as the data and polling has shown time and time again, the economy matters to people. Not necessarily the economic data, the economy, how people feel about it. So it should matter to us to tell a really good, true, empowering story about the economy. [MUSIC PLAYING] transcript This transcript was created using speech recognition software.

  "2025-04-26_506618_1": "Student Opinion Do you want to improve your health, your relationships or your outlook on life? What about your community and the larger world? Has the New Year inspired you to make any changes to your habits and routines? If so, what are your plans and what do you hope to accomplish? Are the changes meant to improve your life? Do you think other people will be affected positively by your resolutions? In the Opinion essay \u201cThis Year, Make a Resolution About Something Bigger Than Yourself,\u201d Roger Rosenblatt writes about what the new year means, and the opportunity it presents to think about how we use our time. He writes: We reflect on the years we\u2019ve lived, on the past resolutions made and broken. Another New Year\u2019s Eve come and gone. Every time the ball drops, the heart sinks. You are running out of time, and time is what we value most. The historian-philosopher Lewis Mumford believed that the clock, not the steam engine, was the principal machine of the industrial age because time has a commanding relationship to the expenditure of human energy, and thus to any product itself. From the start, the essence of industry has been that things run on time. Time touches everything in life, even love. The fundamental things apply. Thus there is always a melancholic desperation and urgency when we shout, \u201cHappy New Year!\u201d Will this new year, in fact, be any better than the last? We resolve that it will. We resolve to be fitter, healthier, cleverer, richer, more successful, more popular, more productive, better dressed, happier. And so restarts the whole vain, foolish, inevitably disappointing cycle. The trouble with all such self-oriented promises is that they deal in chicken feed. What does the great wide world care if you lose weight, or work out, or work harder, or quit drinking or smoking? Quit smoking or smoke three packs a day. Work out daily or let yourself go. It\u2019s your choice, your life. Your little life. Meanwhile, the world \u2014 the whole tortured, self-destructive, polarized, endangered, extraordinary world \u2014 spins on. What if, instead of planning our exercise regimens, we focused our intentions on all that is undesirable in human activity \u2014 wars, bigotry, brutality, the despoiling of the earth \u2014 and sought to address it? What if instead of making a milquetoast resolution, we made airtight commitments? He also suggests that in trying to make the world a better place, we start small: We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

This article contains spoilers for Episode 6 of the final season of \u201cSuccession.\u201d This week was back to business for the Roys. The \u201cCE-Bros\u201d took big swings, leaving a trail of high-profile firings in their wake as they shook things up and tried to tank the deal with Matsson.

He even had flight jackets custom-made to signal the new roles that he and his brother had assumed as pilots for the company\u2019s trip to the moon. Meanwhile, Shiv pulled strings behind the scenes. Jessica Testa: I wonder if people who take their shoes and socks off on airplanes are feeling validated by this week\u2019s episode. Vanessa Friedman: The barefoot moment made it possible to imagine Matsson showing up entirely bare someday. He has been flashing all sorts of skin at different times. We are getting pieces of him to puzzle together. JT: An intriguing proposition! Guy Trebay: And a good point, given all the anxious genital allusions. \u201cBig, big shoes,\u201d as Kendall kept repeating onstage. He feared being unable to fill his father\u2019s.

  "2025-04-26_97375_1": "Frank Bruni Mr. Bruni is a contributing Opinion writer who was on the staff of The Times for more than 25 years. Like many other Americans struggling to find scraps of calm and slivers of hope in this anxious era, I resolved a while back not to get overly excited about Donald Trump\u2019s overexcited utterances. They\u2019re often a showman\u2019s cheap histrionics, a con man\u2019s gaudy hyperbole. But I can\u2019t shake a grandiose prophecy that he made repeatedly last year as he looked toward the 2024 presidential race. He took to calling it the \u201cfinal battle.\u201d I first heard Trump use that phrase in March, when he addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference. I laughed at his indefatigable self-aggrandizement. He said it again weeks later at a rally in Waco, Texas, not far from where the deadly confrontation between the Branch Davidians and federal law enforcement officials took place. I cringed at his perversity. But as he continued to rave biblically about this \u201cfinal battle,\u201d my reaction changed, and it surprised me: He just may be right. Not in his cartoonish description of that conflict \u2014 which pits him and his supporters against the godlessness, lawlessness, tyranny, reverse racism, communism, globalism and open borders of a lunatic left \u2014 but in terms of how profoundly meaningful the 2024 election could be, at least if he is the Republican presidential nominee. And if he wins it all? He will probably play dictator for much longer than a day, and the America that he molds to his self-interested liking may bear little resemblance to the country we\u2019ve known and loved until now. With the Iowa caucuses less than two weeks away, a rematch of Trump and Joe Biden is highly likely \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t be anything close to the usual competition between \u201cfour more years\u201d and a reasonably sane, relatively coherent change of direction and pace. We\u2019re on the cusp of something much scarier. Trump\u2019s fury, vengefulness and ambitions have metastasized since 2020. The ideologues aligned with him have worked out plans for a second Trump administration that are darker and more detailed than anything in the first. He seems better positioned, if elected, to slip free of the restraints and junk the norms that he didn\u2019t manage to do away with before. Yesterday\u2019s Trump was a Komodo dragon next to today\u2019s Godzilla. And Joe Biden, who campaigned in 2020 on a promise to unify the country and prides himself on bipartisanship, has recognized in his own way that \u201cfinal battle\u201d is apt. He has suggested that he is running again, at the age of 81, because the unendurable specter of Trump back in the White House leaves him no other choice. Trump and Biden don\u2019t depict each other simply as bad alternatives for America. They describe each other as cataclysmic ones. This isn\u2019t your usual negative partisanship, in which you try to win by stoking hatred of your opponent. It\u2019s apocalyptic partisanship, in which your opponent is the agent of something like the end of days. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

  "2025-04-26_633087_1": "Guest Essay Ms. Munder, 78, is a retired resident of Nir Oz, Israel. She spent 50 days as a hostage in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. The first time I went to Gaza was in 1967. As a 22-year-old living in the small agricultural kibbutz of Nir Oz, a mile east of the Israeli border with the territory, I would wake up early in the morning to tend to the fields, pick apples in the orchard and work in the day care center. Until the Arab-Israeli War that year, Gaza was a place we worried about, but we didn\u2019t know much about Gazans themselves. The area, then under Egypt\u2019s control, was just across the horizon and posed the threat of infiltrations by fedayeen and of a feared invasion by Arab armies. It cast a shadow over Nir Oz and the other farming collectives around us, part of a region known as the Gaza Envelope. That summer, Israel\u2019s victory over the armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria brought Gaza under Israel\u2019s control, and the shadows of war lifted from Nir Oz. Not long after, I found myself on the back of a tractor with a group of my friends from the kibbutz, driving across the invisible border to the beautiful beach in Khan Younis. On the way back we took a detour through Rafah and picked up pitas for the slow journey home. I have happy memories from that day, and in the years that followed, my interactions with Gazans grew. I met Gazan businessmen who traded with my brother-in-law in the city of Be\u2019er Sheva and who came as guests to my home in Nir Oz. I sat alongside them in the traffic on weekend journeys to Tel Aviv. For a time, you could imagine that we were destined to live together. Nevertheless, we expected that Gaza would eventually return to the Egyptians in exchange for peace and normalization but hoped that the ties with Gazans would remain. After the Camp David Accords left Israel in control of Gaza and the failure of Oslo led to the bloodshed of the second intifada, our hopes for coexistence were extinguished. By the time Israel disengaged unilaterally from Gaza in 2005 and sealed the border, we were strangers once again. I could feel the old shadows slowly returning to Nir Oz as Hamas took power. On Oct. 7, masked Hamas gunmen burst into the bomb shelter inside my home and kidnapped me; my daughter, Keren; and my grandson, Ohad. My husband, Abraham, was knocked out trying to stop the screaming men from entering the safe room and was taken away separately from us. He is still in captivity, his condition unknown. Hamas also killed my son, Roy, as he tried to defend Nir Oz. Later that day I was back in Khan Younis, 56 years after my trip to the beach. Over the next 49 days, I spent most of my time locked in a small room on the second floor of a hospital. My jailer, who went by Mohammad, called himself a soldier of Hamas, but he didn\u2019t look like a soldier. I was being guarded by a man in civilian clothes and held against my will in a civilian building. Mohammad\u2019s broken Hebrew contrasted with the fluent Hebrew that the Gazan businessmen had once spoken in my home. I can imagine that he might have been one of their sons and picked it up from them. I long for a world where he would have been able to build a business of his own, live in dignity and speak fluently with his Israeli neighbors with mutual respect. In that world, I do not believe he would have joined a terrorist group that sent him to watch over a kidnapped grandmother who wished him no harm. Mohammad told me that had it not been for Hamas, he would have had no money or opportunities. It was not quite an apology, more of an explanation, but the bitter irony is that because of Hamas, we both now have nothing. After 50 days as a hostage, I left Khan Younis in a Red Cross vehicle, freed along with my daughter and grandson. I was blindfolded on the way in but now could finally see the city \u2014 because of the war, a shell of the place that I remember from my day on the beach. The Nir Oz I returned to is also a haunted ruin after the Oct. 7 attack. Everything our collective built over almost 70 years has been destroyed. I do not pretend to know what will happen in the years to come. I do not know if Gazans will choose to concentrate their efforts on rebuilding Khan Younis rather than burning Nir Oz. I do not know if young families will ever come back to my kibbutz and pick the fruit from its trees. All I am focused on is getting my husband back home. What I do know is that I will not go to Gaza a third time. Perhaps one day Israelis will again take a trip to the beach in Gaza or host merchants over coffee at their homes. I hope our two peoples can finally live in peace, side by side. And I know that if Hamas remains in power, that will never happen. Ruti Munder, 78, is a retired resident of Nir Oz, Israel.

Every Christmas my husband and I pack up ourselves and our now 8-year-old and leave Brooklyn for a visit to either Nebraska (where my in-laws live) or Alabama (where my family lives). If we\u2019re headed to Omaha, we pack heavy layers because the weather is somewhere between Arctic tundra and what it might feel like to live inside an Icee. If it\u2019s a year when we head to Wetumpka, we pack moderate layers but also short sleeves and maybe even shorts, since 60-to-70-degree Christmases are not unheard-of there. This past year was an Omaha year, and we arrived on the 22nd to find that the weather was very mild \u2014 almost 50 degrees \u2014 and there was no snow. More unusually, there had been no snow for the entire month of December. Aside from some brief and very sparse flurries, it hadn\u2019t snowed in Brooklyn, either, in November or December. I\u2019m an incorrigible heat seeker, and the phrase \u201cwintry mix\u201d fills me with despair. But even so, the lack of cold and ice in 2023 felt unsettling. One reason is easy to quantify: Last year\u2019s warmer temperatures happened globally, and they\u2019re a reminder that without significant climate change interventions we could have a future in our lifetimes where higher temperatures are the norm. Another reason \u2014 a harder one on the psyche but increasingly omnipresent \u2014 is the sense that balmy holidays are a preview of something darker: bigger climate extremes, more natural disasters, the specter not of a world where humans suffer through these things and find ways to survive but where we\u2019ve made the planet so uninhabitable that, in the longer run, the planet survives but we don\u2019t. I was thinking about this while standing outside a science museum a couple of days ago with a friend. We were talking about the weather but not the kind of small talk when you have nothing else to say. \u201cI\u2019m not sure our grandkids will even know what snow is,\u201d she said, with a wry \u201cI\u2019m kidding, but I\u2019m not\u201d laugh. She and her family were leaving for a ski trip the next week, uncertain whether there would be enough snow. For superstitious people like me, who believe that if we think through the worst-case scenarios, the products of our imagination will serve as talismans to ward them off, the disappearance of snow is just one unfortunate potential future scenario. Inasmuch as this is not a defect in the personal architecture of my brain, engaging with the idea of a world without humans is what Eugene Thacker, an author and professor who writes about horror and philosophy, calls \u201ccosmic pessimism.\u201d Climate change around the world:\u00a0In \u201cPostcards From a World on Fire,\u201d 193 stories from individual countries show how climate change is reshaping reality everywhere, from dying coral reefs in Fiji to disappearing oases in Morocco and far, far beyond. The role of our leaders:\u00a0Writing at the end of 2020, Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States, found reasons for optimism\u00a0in the Biden presidency, a feeling perhaps borne out by the passing of major climate legislation. That doesn\u2019t mean there haven\u2019t been criticisms. For example, Charles Harvey and Kurt House argue that subsidies for climate capture technology\u00a0will ultimately be a waste. The worst climate risks, mapped:\u00a0In this feature, select a country, and we'll break down the climate hazards it faces. In the case of America, our maps, developed with experts, show where extreme heat is causing the most deaths. What people can do:\u00a0Justin Gillis and Hal Harvey describe the types of local activism\u00a0that might be needed, while Saul Griffith points to how Australia shows the way on rooftop solar. Meanwhile, small changes at the office\u00a0might be one good way to cut significant emissions, writes Carlos Gamarra. \u201cIts limit-thought is the idea of absolute nothingness,\u201d writes Mr. Thacker, \u201cunconsciously represented in the many popular media images of nuclear war, natural disasters, global pandemics and the cataclysmic effects of climate change.\u201d Just before we left for Omaha, I had been reading his book, cheerily titled \u201cIn the Dust of the Planet,\u201d in which he refers to the human inability to fully confront this \u201cabsolute nothingness\u201d as a unique horror, and while he\u2019s not talking about horror movies, per se, it\u2019s easy to imagine an apocalyptic thriller that begins with the sudden disappearance of snow. We\u2019re accustomed to viewing the world in a human-centric way that says the planet exists for us on some level, and that\u2019s heavily reflected in our culture and religious traditions, including the one I grew up in, where a moody god \u201cso loved the world\u201d that he sacrificed his son to save it. It exists in the techno-optimism of Silicon Valley billionaires who believe that if the planet gets destroyed, they\u2019ll just colonize a new one. But when the weather is doing strange things, it undermines the idea that we are the center of the universe and have potential agency over anything nature can do to us. About a decade ago, when thoughts of climate apocalypse were further from my mind, I went to see a show at the Hayden Planetarium titled \u201cDark Universe.\u201d I like space-related things and other things that can be prefaced with \u201cdark\u201d (chocolate, satire, people who are tall and handsome). As the film took viewers to the deepest corners of space accompanied by the calm, dulcet voice of Neil deGrasse Tyson, I learned about the universe and the much longer list of what wasn\u2019t then known about it. The size and scope of various features of the universe were estimated in relation to the earth and timelines in relation to human\u2019s time on earth. The scale was a reminder of how tiny and fleeting our existence really is. It was glorious and beautiful, and when I stumbled outside into the light, I had what felt like the beginnings of a panic attack brought on by the realization that we live in a delicate ecosystem that is often hostile and could easily destroy us. Then I went home and probably made a to-do list or contributed to a long social media thread about whether a hot dog is technically a sandwich. These moments of dread come more frequently these days, as catastrophic climate events unfold both slowly and in great, ghastly bursts of wildfire and tropical storms. It\u2019s not the absolute events but the deviation from the norm that is alarming. If it\u2019s 70 degrees in Alabama on Dec. 25, I don\u2019t really notice it because that\u2019s normal, but a few years ago, when it was in the high 60s in Brooklyn for a few days in January, I wondered if I should increase my anti-anxiety meds. This past June, Brooklyn was covered in a blanket of smoke from Canadian wildfires. The sky was a muted burnt sienna and the air smelled like a barbecue gone severely wrong. I reassured my son, who had many questions, that the neighborhood was not on fire. It is my job to make my child feel safe, so I answer questions about scary, calamitous things when he asks, but carefully. He is not a sheltered kid and is probably exposed to more of the adult world than many of his peers; he likes creepy things and scary movies and is generally fearless. He gravitates toward questions about death and has asked me whether I\u2019d rather freeze to death or die in a fire so many times that if I didn\u2019t know him, I might be concerned that he was planning something. But he still experiences extreme weather as a novelty and not a threat. I hope he\u2019s much older before he notices a drastic temperature change or more smoke in the air or the fact that it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve and there\u2019s no snow on the ground at home. I believe humans can reverse some of the harm we\u2019ve caused to the environment \u2014 we\u2019ve done it before, which is why the state of the ozone layer is no longer a problem on the heels of the Montreal protocol \u2014 so I\u2019m not a total pessimist. But I am worried. It finally snowed a bit in Omaha, on Christmas Day, no less \u2014 a bit of temporary relief. I\u2019m not worried that my grandchildren, if they ever materialize, will grow up not knowing what snow is, as my friend suggested. But I wonder if, somewhere down the line, one of my descendants will build the last snowman in Omaha. Elizabeth Spiers, a contributing Opinion writer, is a journalist and a digital media strategist.

In 1951, the two main parties, Conservative and Labour, won 97 percent of the vote; current opinion polls suggest that they will be lucky now to win 65 percent. No one expects any party to win an overall majority on May 7. The resulting hung Parliament will mean either a fragile minority government or another European-style coalition. It is not even clear whether David Cameron of the Conservatives, the incumbent, or Ed Miliband of Labour will be the prime minister. So the campaign thus far has been timid, with parties appealing to their core constituencies and trying to beat back their perceived threats in marginal election districts. For the Tories, that threat is the anti-Europe, anti-immigration United Kingdom Independence Party; for Labour, it is the Scottish National Party, which endangers about half of Labour\u2019s 41 Scottish seats. The campaign has focused mostly on personalities, who will cut the budget better, the dangers of Islamic radicalism, and which candidate loves the National Health Service the most. There has been little discussion of foreign policy, other than caricatures of the European Union; there has been almost no talk of Russia and Ukraine, or of Syria and Iraq. Nor has there been much of a debate on the effect of current and future military spending cuts, on modernizing and retaining Britain\u2019s submarine-based nuclear deterrent, and indeed on the country\u2019s shrinking role in world affairs, where Paris \u2014 despite its own economic troubles \u2014 can seem a more useful and capable strategic partner to Washington than London.

  "2025-04-26_696945_1": "Supported by BOSTON \u2014 A divided federal appeals court has rejected a motion by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, accused in the Boston Marathon bombing, to move his trial out of the city, paving the way for opening statements in the case to begin Wednesday. In a 34-page majority opinion and a blistering 45-page dissent, the jurists disagreed, 2 to 1, over whether a jury drawn from among five million people in eastern Massachusetts, where the deadly bombings occurred, could be fair and impartial. Mere knowledge of a case is not the same thing as prejudice, the majority said; the dissenter said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to suggest that someone from here could be impartial when \u201cthe entire Boston community has been terrorized, victimized and brutalized by such a horrendous act of violence.\u201d Mr. Tsarnaev, 21, is accused of planting bombs at the finish line in 2013, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others. He has pleaded not guilty to all 30 federal counts against him, 17 of which carry the death penalty. Over 24 days, Judge George A. O\u2019Toole Jr. of Federal District Court has overseen the selection of 75 provisionally qualified jurors from more than 250 whom he questioned individually. On Tuesday, the defense and prosecution will whittle down the 75 to 12 jurors and six alternates, who will hear the case beginning Wednesday. (The court needed to qualify only 64 to seat a jury but opted to qualify 75 to be safe, according to court papers.) Judge O\u2019Toole has suggested that the trial could run through June. The defense had tried four times before to have the trial moved. Judge O\u2019Toole had rejected it three times, and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had rejected it once. The appeals court denied the defense\u2019s latest attempt late Friday, this time responding with a detailed opinion.  In their majority ruling, Chief Judge Sandra L. Lynch and Judge Jeffrey R. Howard said they were loath to second-guess Judge O\u2019Toole. They said Mr. Tsarnaev had not shown that Judge O\u2019Toole was wrong to keep the trial in Boston and had not shown that irreparable harm would result from doing so. Indeed, the court said, if Mr. Tsarnaev is convicted, \u201che will have the opportunity to raise a challenge based on lack of a fair and impartial jury on direct appeal.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_343676_1": "Guest Essay Dr. Buolamwini is founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, which seeks to raise awareness about the potential harms of artificial intelligence, and the author of \u201cUnmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What Is Human in a World of Machines.\u201d Mr. Friedman is a professor at New York University\u2019s School of Law, where he is the faculty director of its Policing Project. He is the author of \u201cUnwarranted: Policing Without Permission.\u201d One of the most hopeful proposals involving police surveillance emerged recently from a surprising quarter \u2014 the federal Office of Management and Budget. The office, which oversees the execution of the president\u2019s policies, has recommended sorely needed constraints on the use of artificial intelligence by federal agencies, including law enforcement. The office\u2019s work is commendable, but shortcomings in its proposed guidance to agencies could still leave people vulnerable to harm. Foremost among them is a provision that would allow senior officials to seek waivers by arguing that the constraints would hinder law enforcement. Those law enforcement agencies should instead be required to provide verifiable evidence that A.I. tools they or their vendors use will not cause harm, worsen discrimination or violate people\u2019s rights. As scholars of algorithmic tools, policing and constitutional law, we have witnessed the predictable and preventable harms from law enforcement\u2019s use of emerging technologies. These include false arrests and police seizures, including a family held at gunpoint, after people were wrongly accused of crimes because of the irresponsible use of A.I.-driven technologies including facial recognition and automated license plate readers. Consider the cases of Porcha Woodruff, Michael Oliver and Robert Julian-Borchak Williams. All were arrested between 2019 and 2023 after they were misidentified by facial recognition technology. These arrests had indelible \u00ad\u00ad\u00adconsequences: Ms. Woodruff was eight months pregnant when she was falsely accused of carjacking and robbery; Mr. Williams was arrested in front of his wife and two young daughters as he pulled into his driveway from work. Mr. Oliver lost his job as a result. All are Black. This should not be a surprise. A 2018 study co-written by one of us (Dr. Buolamwini) found that three commercial facial-analysis programs from major technology companies showed both skin-type and gender biases. The darker the skin, the more often the errors arose. Questions of fairness and bias persist about the use of these sorts of technologies. Errors happen because law enforcement deploys emerging technologies without transparency or community agreement that they should be used at all, with little or no consideration of the consequences, insufficient training and inadequate guardrails. Often the data sets that drive the technologies are infected with errors and racial bias. Typically, the officers or agencies face no consequences for false arrests, increasing the likelihood they will continue. The Office of Management and Budget guidance, which is now being finalized after a period of public comment, would apply to law enforcement technologies such as facial recognition, license-plate readers, predictive policing tools, gunshot detection, social media monitoring and more. It sets out criteria for A.I. technologies that, without safeguards, could put people\u2019s safety or well-being at risk or violate their rights. If these proposed \u201cminimum practices\u201d are not met, technologies that fall short would be prohibited after next Aug. 1. Here are highlights of the proposal: Agencies must be transparent and provide a public inventory of cases in which A.I. was used. The cost and benefit of these technologies must be assessed, a consideration that has been altogether absent. Even if the technology provides real benefits, the risks to individuals \u2014 especially in marginalized communities \u2014 must be identified and reduced. If the risks are too high, the technology may not be used. The impact of A.I.-driven technologies must be tested in the real world, and be continually monitored. Agencies would have to solicit public comment before using the technologies, including from the affected communities. The proposed requirements are serious ones. They should have been in place before law enforcement began using these emerging technologies. Given the rapid adoption of these tools, without evidence of equity or efficacy and with insufficient attention to preventing mistakes, we fully anticipate some A.I. technologies will not meet the proposed standards and their use will be banned for noncompliance. The overall thrust of the federal A.I. initiative is to push for rapid use of untested technologies by law enforcement, an approach that too often fails and causes harm. For that reason, the Office of Management and Budget must play a serious oversight role. Far and away, the most worrisome elements in the proposal are provisions that create the opportunity for loopholes. For example, the chief A.I. officer of each federal agency could waive proposed protections with nothing more than a justification sent to the Office of Management and Budget. Worse yet, the justification need only claim \u201can unacceptable impediment to critical agency operations\u201d \u2014 the sort of claim law enforcement regularly makes to avoid regulation. This waiver provision has the potential to wipe away all that the proposal promises. No waiver should be permitted without clear proof that it is essential \u2014 proof that in our experience law enforcement typically cannot muster. No one person should have the power to issue such a waiver. There must be careful review to ensure that waivers are legitimate. Unless the recommendations are enforced strictly, we will see more surveillance, more people forced into unjustified encounters with law enforcement, and more harm to communities of color. Technologies that are clearly shown to be discriminatory should not be used. There is also a vague exception for \u201cnational security,\u201d a phrase frequently used to excuse policing from legal protections for civil rights and against discrimination. \u201cNational security\u201d requires a sharper definition to prevent the exemption from being invoked without valid cause or oversight. Finally, nothing in this proposal applies beyond federal government agencies. The F.B.I., the Transportation Security Administration and other federal agencies are aggressively embracing facial recognition and other biometric technologies that can recognize individuals by their unique physical characteristics. But so are state and local agencies, which do not fall under these guidelines. The federal government regularly offers federal funding as a carrot to win compliance from state and local agencies with federal rules. It should do the same here. We hope the Office of Management and Budget will set a higher standard at the federal level for law enforcement\u2019s use of emerging technologies, a standard that state and local governments should also follow. It would be a shame to make the progress envisioned in this proposal and have it undermined by backdoor exceptions.

From \u201cThe New York Times,\u201d I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d As 2024 begins, we examine the campaign strategies of the two leading candidates for president, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, to understand what they\u2019ll look like over the next year. Today, my colleague, Maggie Haberman, on how Trump is trying to wrap up the Republican nomination before any court case can stop him. It\u2019s Tuesday, January 2. Maggie. Michael. Happy New Year to you. Happy New Year to you. This is our first episode of 2024. I am honored to be here with you for your first episode of 2024. And we decided to give our listeners a set of handrails to understand what is likely to be the biggest story of the year, which is the presidential race the 2024 campaign. And we turn to you, Maggie, to better understand the candidacy of Donald Trump. You have chronicled Trump now for \u2014 ever? And a day. It\u2019s been a long time. Trump, who, of course, leads his Republican rivals by what feels like historic margins. And what we really want you to do is give us a blueprint for what his candidacy is going to look like, what it\u2019s going to feel like, and have you help us understand its overarching strategy and its message. And I think we have to start with the reality that this campaign is really defined by how much Trump has become a defendant, and not in just one court, but in many courts and the many cases where he\u2019s been indicted or sued. So just, I guess, start there. Sure. I often say that this is not a campaign. It\u2019s a series of court dates wrapped around some debates. And that\u2019s really been true. These court cases are the centerpiece of Donald Trump\u2019s life right now. And because of that, they have been integrated into his campaign messaging, fundraising, and with him as the likely Republican nominee, the entire election. So if you think about it going back to March, he has been indicted four times. He\u2019s been indicted over hush-money payments made to an adult film star in the 2016 campaign. That\u2019s the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s case. He\u2019s been indicted by the federal government over his handling of classified documents. He\u2019s been indicted by the special counsel over his efforts to overturn the election results. And he\u2019s been indicted by the Fulton County District Attorney in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the election results in that state. He faces 91 counts in those cases, and those are criminal charges. Right. That\u2019s a lot of counts. That\u2019s a lot of cases. A lot of felony counts. Beyond that, there are two civil cases. There\u2019s the E. Jean Carroll defamation case. Remember, she is a woman who said that Trump sexually assaulted her decades ago and that he defamed her. And there is a civil case brought by the New York Attorney General that accuses him of financial fraud. So just logistically, all of these cases take up a lot of his time. They will ultimately make campaigning somewhat tricky to schedule. For the criminal cases, he must be in court. Right, and it\u2019s hard to schedule a rally, a fundraiser, a meet-and-greet weeks or months out when you\u2019ve got this many court cases that may require you to be in court. That\u2019s just going to be a reality for him. It\u2019s unlike any reality, I think, any leading candidate for president has ever faced. Yes. And as a result, his campaign, for months, has been coming up with a strategy that could ensure that he is still a political candidate, no matter what happens in those court cases. + And what is that strategy? So it was an elaborate backroom campaign, using his influence over the Republican Party to try to make sure that he has wrapped up the nomination, the number of delegates that he needs to become the nominee as fast as he can, to make sure that if he is convicted in one of these cases, it can\u2019t be taken away from him when it comes time for the party\u2019s convention in July. OK, so what does this backroom campaign actually look like on the ground? So it\u2019s essentially a lot of schmoozing and gladhanding and sort of traditional politics, all of which are working toward the ultimate goal of having the system work better for Donald Trump. The system, of course, being the nomination of a Republican candidate for president. Correct, which itself involves a lot of series of state Republican Party rules that get changed in the fall the year before the general election. So some of this was pretty traditional-looking, right? Trump has made a bunch of phone calls to officials in various states. One was Hawaii, where the state party chairman was elected in May and, soon after, got a voicemail from Trump. And it\u2019s a very classic Trump message. \u201cIt\u2019s your all-time favorite president. I just called to congratulate you.\u201d Seemingly small, but probably quite meaningful for him. Correct. It\u2019s the kind of thing that is pretty cost-free for Trump, that he doles out pretty easily. And then, there\u2019s the Mar-a-Lago aspect of it, where Trump has people down to his club and courts them. So there was a dinner with state Republican officials, including the head of the Nevada GOP, who\u2019s a Trump ally. Months after this dinner at Mar-a-Lago, the Nevada GOP significantly changed their rules around their nominating contest that put Ron DeSantis at a huge disadvantage. How so? Well, they basically blocked the super PAC that DeSantis has been relying on for months from taking part in the state caucuses. This new rule basically bars super PACs from sending in speakers or literature, even just pamphlets, to caucus sites, or even getting data from the state party, meaning data they can use to approach voters. That really, really harmed DeSantis. It was a laser aimed at him. I just want to be clear. This is an important chronology. The head of the Nevada Republican Party goes to a dinner at Mar-a-Lago and, obviously, spent some real time with Trump, and gets some affection and some exposure. And not long after, Nevada changes how campaigns can be run in the state in a way that empowers Trump and kind of kneecaps his biggest rival, Ron DeSantis. The Nevada GOP did. It was building toward state election rules that ultimately favor Trump, according to people close to Trump and people on campaigns aligned with his rivals. And the impact of it has been pretty dramatic, which is that no serious candidate is really campaigning in Nevada. Super PACs have not been airing ads on behalf of their candidates. Basically, everybody has forgone the state. So basically, this rule change has resulted in everybody ceding Nevada to Donald Trump. Even if they\u2019re not actually doing it, that\u2019s the effect. Where else has Trump\u2019s backroom campaign been effective? So California \u2014 they made the biggest changes of any state to primary rules to favor Trump this cycle. And Republicans there changed the formula for how delegates are allocated. In the past, there\u2019s 52 congressional districts in the state, and candidates could go to each one. And if you won the district, you would pick up delegates. But the Trump campaign pushed for changes to those rules this year for a winner-take-all system. And now, the GOP in California is going to give all 169 of its delegates to a candidate who meets the winner-take-all threshold of over 50 percent statewide. I mean, that\u2019s a very high threshold \u2014 a candidate getting 50 percent. In fact, that seems pretty much tailormade for Donald Trump. It certainly does if you\u2019re looking at all of the polling right now. So in California, the Trump campaign changes the rules, it feels like, so that he and only he can pretty much win every single delegate. And 169 delegates is a fair amount of delegates. He\u2019s kind of taking a state off the map for his rivals. Correct. And he is doing it in a state, California, which votes on Super Tuesday. And that is the first week of March. So it is part of a bigger plan to have the nomination wrapped up by the end of March, in terms of how many delegates he has. And March is significant for another reason. It\u2019s currently when the trial in Washington, DC, on charges of illegally subverting the election in 2020, is scheduled to begin. Now, it\u2019s not likely to begin then. It will be a little delayed. But that\u2019s the track it\u2019s on. And if that trial doesn\u2019t start in March, Alvin Bragg \u2014 The DA of New York. \u2014 may start the hush money case, which is also expected in March. So March is a key month for him. Right. And according to the rule changes you have just described, Trump\u2019s going to be a lot closer, combined with his poll numbers, to becoming the nominee before or just as those trials are starting. Therefore, he will become the nominee, we suspect, before there\u2019s a verdict in any of those cases. That is correct. Maggie, has anyone observed that what the Trump campaign is up to here looks and sounds a lot like maybe rigging? Right? A word that Trump uses a lot \u2014 sometimes falsely, but a lot? Yes, people are very upset about this, Michael. Among them is Ken Cuccinelli, who was a Trump administration official when Trump was president, who now supports Ron DeSantis. He used that exact word to Shane Goldmacher and Jonathan Swan and me. He said, quote, \u201cthey\u2019ve rigged it anywhere they thought they could pull it off,\u201d unquote. We should, of course, point out that everything Trump is doing within the Republican Party rule changes \u2014 and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 is perfectly legal. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s very aggressive, and it clearly exploits his unusual level of power over party leadership. Now, so far, what you\u2019re describing is local state level. Does this backroom campaign extend to the national Republican apparatus, to the Republican National Committee itself? Yes, Michael, it does. So remember that Trump, assuming he wins all of these primaries, will not officially be nominated as the GOP nominee for president until the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July. And you can see a world where he\u2019s convicted of a crime, and some faction of the party that does not want a nominee who\u2019s been convicted of a crime tries to embark on a last-minute effort to get somebody else nominated. And so what Trump\u2019s team is trying to do is make sure that the Rules Committee does not have the ability to make a bunch of changes that would favor another candidate and not Trump. And so an example might be a rule that would say you can\u2019t be the nominee if you\u2019re convicted of a crime, or even that you can\u2019t be the nominee if you\u2019re indicted. Fascinating. And Trump has a lot of allies on the Rules Committee. And they are expected to be watching this process very, very carefully. So we should understand that in the same way that Trump has essentially huge influence, maybe even veto power, over state rules, he has that same power over national Republican rules. Correct. And I expect that his campaign is going to try to exert more and more influence over the national party in the coming months. So in a real sense, the Trump campaign has thought of everything. It\u2019s thought of how to ensure that no one can really challenge him. He\u2019s taking states off the map, and he\u2019s making sure that if a court case goes against him, the party really can\u2019t do all that much about it. That\u2019s right. The way to think about this is that the Trump team this time, which is staffed with much more seasoned people than his 2016 campaign \u2014 they\u2019re trying to eliminate unpredictability at a moment when the court cases create so much unpredictability. So the way to think about Trump\u2019s 2024 strategy, especially within the context of ensuring he wins the Republican primary, is that his team is basically building a court-proof strategy for what we expect to be a very courtroom-bound candidate who could be found guilty of some very serious crimes. Yes. And of course, he is still campaigning, and he\u2019s not required to be in court right now. He\u2019s acting like he\u2019s running a typical campaign. He\u2019s doing rallies. And that\u2019s where you see the other blueprint for this candidacy \u2014 the public message. And that\u2019s just as revealing as the backroom campaign we\u2019ve been talking about. We\u2019ll be right back. Maggie, let\u2019s now talk about this, as you said, second blueprint for Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2014 the message he\u2019s delivering at his rallies. You have been watching and, I assume, attending these rallies. Mostly watching, recently attending, yes. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump! OK, so let\u2019s start with how Trump addresses the legal questions that we have just been talking about. What exactly is the message he\u2019s delivering about all of this? So in fact, I was at a rally that he did at the end of December in New Hampshire. Every time the radical-left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor, because I am being indicted for you. Thank you very much. He has a bunch of familiar tactics that he uses. He tells his supporters that really, these prosecutors are after them. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they\u2019re not after me. They\u2019re after you. I just happen to be standing in the way, and I will always be \u2014 And because he\u2019s standing up for them, and he\u2019s just in the way. But he started wrapping that in new language. It\u2019s no wonder Biden and the far-left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary. They\u2019re willing to violate the US Constitution. Which is saying that actually, it\u2019s President Biden who is puppeteering all of this. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. He\u2019s a threat. And that Democrats are the real threat to this country. So you know, we talk about democracy, but the whole world is watching the persecution of a political opponent that\u2019s kicking his ass. It\u2019s an amazing thing. I want to zero in on something you just said, which is that Trump is now claiming Democrats are a threat to democracy. That, of course, is complicated \u2014 perhaps to many years, ironic \u2014 because Democrats, and not just Democrats, view Trump and what he did around the 2020 election, the very reason he\u2019s in so much legal trouble, as a direct threat to democracy. I mean, he tried to overturn a democratic election he didn\u2019t like the results of. So he\u2019s trying \u2014 and this seems quite strained \u2014 to flip that around and say, no, the real threat to democracy is President Biden, because his Justice Department has brought some of these cases. Correct. In Trump\u2019s telling, Trump has done nothing wrong, of course, and it\u2019s that President Biden has weaponized the federal justice system to go after a rival and is even controlling these state-based cases in Georgia and New York. For which there is no evidence. For which there is no evidence in any of it that President Biden is directing this. But it\u2019s a sign that Trump and his team know that what Democrats are saying about Trump as a threat to democracy is having some effect in terms of the public. Just explain that. The attacks on Trump and the description of Trump as a threat to democracy, his behavior ahead of January 6, 2021, the things he said about Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 these are not pluses with independent voters and some Republicans. And Trump\u2019s team is aware of that. And they are concerned about the general election and what those attacks could look like. And so Trump is doing what Trump does best, which is try to muddy the waters \u2014 Right. \u2014 and say, actually, it\u2019s the other guy doing this thing I\u2019m accused of doing, so that voters can\u2019t really tell the difference anymore. Got it. So for the most part, he\u2019s not really engaging with the cases brought against him. And like you said, he\u2019s using them as an opportunity to simply go after Biden. Exactly. Well, talk about the ways that Trump is going after Biden beyond a kind of reverse projection of his legal problems. So he wraps all of his discussions related to the court cases around an attack on Biden where Biden is weakest, which is on the economy. The next economic boom will begin the instant the world knows that crooked Joe Biden is gone and Donald J. Trump has won four more years as president of United States. And despite a lot of economic indicators looking good, we know that many people don\u2019t feel good about the economy. Things cost more. It\u2019s difficult to afford a home. When I was at a rally that he did in New Hampshire at the end of December, there was a screen over Trump\u2019s head where he showed the mortgage rate. The average monthly mortgage payment has gone from $1,746 under my administration to $3,322 today. But you can\u2019t get the money, so it doesn\u2019t matter. And the point there is, things were better when I was president. Put me back in office. You\u2019ll have more money in your wallet. As long as Joe Biden is in the White House, the American dream is dead. But all of that will change the minute the polls close on election night, 2024. It\u2019s a pitch to a lot of voters. The economy is a pretty basic fact in most presidential elections. But it could particularly appeal to independents or suburbanites who turned away from him. Right, so this is the part of the rally where he\u2019s not just thinking about becoming the nominee, which, as we\u2019ve talked about, through his strategy, he feels kind of assured of. He\u2019s now pitching himself to the full American electorate. That\u2019s right. And beyond the economy, he spends a lot of time railing against the state of the country, particularly so when he\u2019s talking about immigration and crime. You know, when they let \u2014 I think the real number is 15, 16 million people into our country \u2014 when they do that, we got a lot of work to do. And he made a pretty shocking statement at the New Hampshire rally. They\u2019re poisoning the blood of our country. That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve poison mental institutions and prisons all over the world, not just \u2014 He described undocumented immigrants as poisoning the blood of America. I just want to talk to you about that language. What do you think he was doing? Why was he doing it? How should we think about it? Well, it\u2019s language that echoes language used by Adolf Hitler. It is language that echoes fascists across history. It\u2019s pretty shocking to hear a front-runner for one of the two major parties in this country describing undocumented immigrants this way. And it invokes a blood purity that is the language used by white supremacists. And it was not the first time Trump said it, but it was Trump doubling down on it. And in a sense, it\u2019s in keeping with how Trump has, at times, campaigned and talked. You were at the beginning of Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 when he talked about immigrants from Mexico. It\u2019s very jarring to hear him do it eight years later. There is always an argument about whether Trump is actually intensifying his language or escalating his language. And he just objectively is. And I will direct and completely overhaul DOJ to investigate every radical, out-of-control, fake, crooked prosecutor in America, for their illegal, racist-in-reverse enforcement of the law. The language where he describes Black prosecutors who are investigating him as \u201creverse racists\u201d is pretty shocking. What he\u2019s really saying is they hate white people? Yes. For which there is no evidence. He\u2019s not being investigated because he\u2019s white. But it does play into his crowd. I think as he has gotten angrier and as he has become more embattled, he has become more emboldened in what he is saying. Right. More willing to take greater risks in the kind of extremeness of what he\u2019s willing to say. And ignore people who tell him that this could be very damaging to him down the road politically, and inciting to people who listen to it. When you think about everything we\u2019re talking about here, there\u2019s a kind of deja-vu-all-over-again quality. This is Trump\u2019s playbook, and it didn\u2019t work for him four years ago. He lost. So how should we think about why it might be more effective in 2024 than it was in 2020? I think the right way to think about the current campaign is that it\u2019s more like 2016 than 2020. Hmm. More like the first campaign, which he won, than the second, that he didn\u2019t. Correct. In 2020, enough of a percentage of Americans were really tired of Trump. They were tired of the drama. They were tired of the chaos. He had been president for four years. People wanted a change, and Trump lost. 2016 was the campaign where Trump ran as an outsider against someone who was basically running as an incumbent \u2014 Hillary Clinton, who was basically running as a continuation of President Obama. And Trump obviously beat her. This campaign, so far, feels more like 2016. And Trump is better running as an insurgent than an incumbent. And you\u2019re seeing that again. Right. And in a sense, he can run as an insurgent, even though he had been president, because he hasn\u2019t been president the past four years. Correct. And because of that, his playbook might be more effective than it was in 2020. Let me just synthesize everything that you have, I think, explained. At the end of the day, this is a campaign about victimhood. Does that feel right? I mean, Trump\u2019s victimhood, in his telling, and America\u2019s victimhood. Trump\u2019s telling voters that he\u2019s a victim of these court cases, and he\u2019s telling voters, he\u2019s telling America, that they are victims of Biden\u2019s policies. That\u2019s what 2024 is going to sound like in the hands of Donald Trump. And I guess the question, based on your reporting and your analysis, your understanding of this race, is \u2014 is that potentially a winning message? That is exactly what the landscape is for 2024. And the reason it could be a winning message \u2014 and again, who knows \u2014 is President Biden\u2019s numbers remain quite poor. If they get better, it might not be a winning message. If the economy gets better, and in ways that voters feel good about, it might not, but that\u2019s basically the message Trump feels he has. And he\u2019s going to push it endlessly. And let me ask you this. If Trump is convicted of something between now and the general election next November, does this framework therefore get reinforced and deepened and stronger? Or does it ultimately all actually kind of collapse? Because a conviction is a conviction, and Americans can\u2019t wrap their heads around a convicted person being their president. We are seeing data in our own polling, the paper\u2019s polling, that suggested that more Republicans, more Trump voters, don\u2019t think that he should be the nominee if he is convicted. It suggests to me that people had not really been tuning in to what was happening with Trump legally. They will be in 2024, and things may end up looking different. In other words, these court cases \u2014 and this is where we started \u2014 they really do matter. They really do matter. Well, Maggie, thank you very much. Michael, thank you. Over the past few days, Trump\u2019s legal problems have only mounted. The Secretary of State in Maine sought to remove Trump from the state\u2019s Republican primary ballot, citing his efforts to overturn the results of the last election. Maine joins Colorado, whose Supreme Court ruled a week earlier that Trump could be removed from the Republican ballot in that state for the same reason. For now, Trump remains on the ballot in both states, as the cases make their way through the appeals process and, many predict, all the way up to the US Supreme Court in the coming weeks. Tomorrow on \u201cThe Daily,\u201d we turn to the campaign strategy of President Biden. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Monday, Israel said that it would begin withdrawing several thousand troops from Gaza, at least temporarily, in what would be the most significant publicly announced pullback since the war began. Israel has been under growing pressure to de-escalate its presence in Gaza, but in describing the pullback, it said the decision was primarily driven by the need to restore normalcy to the Israeli economy, which has been hurt by the massive mobilization of reservists. Meanwhile, in a momentous ruling, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court has struck down a law passed last year by the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that was designed to reduce the court\u2019s own power. The law, which made it harder for the courts to overrule decisions made by government ministers, touched off mass protests across Israel and raised questions about the health of the country\u2019s democracy. In response to Monday\u2019s decision, Netanyahu\u2019s party rebuked the Supreme Court for issuing what it said was a divisive ruling during a time of war.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d As 2024 begins, we examine the campaign strategies of the two leading candidates for president, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, to understand what they\u2019ll look like over the next year. Today, my colleague, Maggie Haberman, on how Trump is trying to wrap up the Republican nomination before any court case can stop him. It\u2019s Tuesday, January 2. Maggie. Michael. Happy New Year to you. Happy New Year to you. This is our first episode of 2024. I am honored to be here with you for your first episode of 2024. And we decided to give our listeners a set of handrails to understand what is likely to be the biggest story of the year, which is the presidential race the 2024 campaign. And we turn to you, Maggie, to better understand the candidacy of Donald Trump. You have chronicled Trump now for \u2014 ever? And a day. It\u2019s been a long time. Trump, who, of course, leads his Republican rivals by what feels like historic margins. And what we really want you to do is give us a blueprint for what his candidacy is going to look like, what it\u2019s going to feel like, and have you help us understand its overarching strategy and its message. And I think we have to start with the reality that this campaign is really defined by how much Trump has become a defendant, and not in just one court, but in many courts and the many cases where he\u2019s been indicted or sued. So just, I guess, start there. Sure. I often say that this is not a campaign. It\u2019s a series of court dates wrapped around some debates. And that\u2019s really been true. These court cases are the centerpiece of Donald Trump\u2019s life right now. And because of that, they have been integrated into his campaign messaging, fundraising, and with him as the likely Republican nominee, the entire election. So if you think about it going back to March, he has been indicted four times. He\u2019s been indicted over hush-money payments made to an adult film star in the 2016 campaign. That\u2019s the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s case. He\u2019s been indicted by the federal government over his handling of classified documents. He\u2019s been indicted by the special counsel over his efforts to overturn the election results. And he\u2019s been indicted by the Fulton County District Attorney in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the election results in that state. He faces 91 counts in those cases, and those are criminal charges. Right. That\u2019s a lot of counts. That\u2019s a lot of cases. A lot of felony counts. Beyond that, there are two civil cases. There\u2019s the E. Jean Carroll defamation case. Remember, she is a woman who said that Trump sexually assaulted her decades ago and that he defamed her. And there is a civil case brought by the New York Attorney General that accuses him of financial fraud. So just logistically, all of these cases take up a lot of his time. They will ultimately make campaigning somewhat tricky to schedule. For the criminal cases, he must be in court. Right, and it\u2019s hard to schedule a rally, a fundraiser, a meet-and-greet weeks or months out when you\u2019ve got this many court cases that may require you to be in court. That\u2019s just going to be a reality for him. It\u2019s unlike any reality, I think, any leading candidate for president has ever faced. Yes. And as a result, his campaign, for months, has been coming up with a strategy that could ensure that he is still a political candidate, no matter what happens in those court cases. + And what is that strategy? So it was an elaborate backroom campaign, using his influence over the Republican Party to try to make sure that he has wrapped up the nomination, the number of delegates that he needs to become the nominee as fast as he can, to make sure that if he is convicted in one of these cases, it can\u2019t be taken away from him when it comes time for the party\u2019s convention in July. OK, so what does this backroom campaign actually look like on the ground? So it\u2019s essentially a lot of schmoozing and gladhanding and sort of traditional politics, all of which are working toward the ultimate goal of having the system work better for Donald Trump. The system, of course, being the nomination of a Republican candidate for president. Correct, which itself involves a lot of series of state Republican Party rules that get changed in the fall the year before the general election. So some of this was pretty traditional-looking, right? Trump has made a bunch of phone calls to officials in various states. One was Hawaii, where the state party chairman was elected in May and, soon after, got a voicemail from Trump. And it\u2019s a very classic Trump message. \u201cIt\u2019s your all-time favorite president. I just called to congratulate you.\u201d Seemingly small, but probably quite meaningful for him. Correct. It\u2019s the kind of thing that is pretty cost-free for Trump, that he doles out pretty easily. And then, there\u2019s the Mar-a-Lago aspect of it, where Trump has people down to his club and courts them. So there was a dinner with state Republican officials, including the head of the Nevada GOP, who\u2019s a Trump ally. Months after this dinner at Mar-a-Lago, the Nevada GOP significantly changed their rules around their nominating contest that put Ron DeSantis at a huge disadvantage. How so? Well, they basically blocked the super PAC that DeSantis has been relying on for months from taking part in the state caucuses. This new rule basically bars super PACs from sending in speakers or literature, even just pamphlets, to caucus sites, or even getting data from the state party, meaning data they can use to approach voters. That really, really harmed DeSantis. It was a laser aimed at him. I just want to be clear. This is an important chronology. The head of the Nevada Republican Party goes to a dinner at Mar-a-Lago and, obviously, spent some real time with Trump, and gets some affection and some exposure. And not long after, Nevada changes how campaigns can be run in the state in a way that empowers Trump and kind of kneecaps his biggest rival, Ron DeSantis. The Nevada GOP did. It was building toward state election rules that ultimately favor Trump, according to people close to Trump and people on campaigns aligned with his rivals. And the impact of it has been pretty dramatic, which is that no serious candidate is really campaigning in Nevada. Super PACs have not been airing ads on behalf of their candidates. Basically, everybody has forgone the state. So basically, this rule change has resulted in everybody ceding Nevada to Donald Trump. Even if they\u2019re not actually doing it, that\u2019s the effect. Where else has Trump\u2019s backroom campaign been effective? So California \u2014 they made the biggest changes of any state to primary rules to favor Trump this cycle. And Republicans there changed the formula for how delegates are allocated. In the past, there\u2019s 52 congressional districts in the state, and candidates could go to each one. And if you won the district, you would pick up delegates. But the Trump campaign pushed for changes to those rules this year for a winner-take-all system. And now, the GOP in California is going to give all 169 of its delegates to a candidate who meets the winner-take-all threshold of over 50 percent statewide. I mean, that\u2019s a very high threshold \u2014 a candidate getting 50 percent. In fact, that seems pretty much tailormade for Donald Trump. It certainly does if you\u2019re looking at all of the polling right now. So in California, the Trump campaign changes the rules, it feels like, so that he and only he can pretty much win every single delegate. And 169 delegates is a fair amount of delegates. He\u2019s kind of taking a state off the map for his rivals. Correct. And he is doing it in a state, California, which votes on Super Tuesday. And that is the first week of March. So it is part of a bigger plan to have the nomination wrapped up by the end of March, in terms of how many delegates he has. And March is significant for another reason. It\u2019s currently when the trial in Washington, DC, on charges of illegally subverting the election in 2020, is scheduled to begin. Now, it\u2019s not likely to begin then. It will be a little delayed. But that\u2019s the track it\u2019s on. And if that trial doesn\u2019t start in March, Alvin Bragg \u2014 The DA of New York. \u2014 may start the hush money case, which is also expected in March. So March is a key month for him. Right. And according to the rule changes you have just described, Trump\u2019s going to be a lot closer, combined with his poll numbers, to becoming the nominee before or just as those trials are starting. Therefore, he will become the nominee, we suspect, before there\u2019s a verdict in any of those cases. That is correct. Maggie, has anyone observed that what the Trump campaign is up to here looks and sounds a lot like maybe rigging? Right? A word that Trump uses a lot \u2014 sometimes falsely, but a lot? Yes, people are very upset about this, Michael. Among them is Ken Cuccinelli, who was a Trump administration official when Trump was president, who now supports Ron DeSantis. He used that exact word to Shane Goldmacher and Jonathan Swan and me. He said, quote, \u201cthey\u2019ve rigged it anywhere they thought they could pull it off,\u201d unquote. We should, of course, point out that everything Trump is doing within the Republican Party rule changes \u2014 and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 is perfectly legal. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s very aggressive, and it clearly exploits his unusual level of power over party leadership. Now, so far, what you\u2019re describing is local state level. Does this backroom campaign extend to the national Republican apparatus, to the Republican National Committee itself? Yes, Michael, it does. So remember that Trump, assuming he wins all of these primaries, will not officially be nominated as the GOP nominee for president until the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July. And you can see a world where he\u2019s convicted of a crime, and some faction of the party that does not want a nominee who\u2019s been convicted of a crime tries to embark on a last-minute effort to get somebody else nominated. And so what Trump\u2019s team is trying to do is make sure that the Rules Committee does not have the ability to make a bunch of changes that would favor another candidate and not Trump. And so an example might be a rule that would say you can\u2019t be the nominee if you\u2019re convicted of a crime, or even that you can\u2019t be the nominee if you\u2019re indicted. Fascinating. And Trump has a lot of allies on the Rules Committee. And they are expected to be watching this process very, very carefully. So we should understand that in the same way that Trump has essentially huge influence, maybe even veto power, over state rules, he has that same power over national Republican rules. Correct. And I expect that his campaign is going to try to exert more and more influence over the national party in the coming months. So in a real sense, the Trump campaign has thought of everything. It\u2019s thought of how to ensure that no one can really challenge him. He\u2019s taking states off the map, and he\u2019s making sure that if a court case goes against him, the party really can\u2019t do all that much about it. That\u2019s right. The way to think about this is that the Trump team this time, which is staffed with much more seasoned people than his 2016 campaign \u2014 they\u2019re trying to eliminate unpredictability at a moment when the court cases create so much unpredictability. So the way to think about Trump\u2019s 2024 strategy, especially within the context of ensuring he wins the Republican primary, is that his team is basically building a court-proof strategy for what we expect to be a very courtroom-bound candidate who could be found guilty of some very serious crimes. Yes. And of course, he is still campaigning, and he\u2019s not required to be in court right now. He\u2019s acting like he\u2019s running a typical campaign. He\u2019s doing rallies. And that\u2019s where you see the other blueprint for this candidacy \u2014 the public message. And that\u2019s just as revealing as the backroom campaign we\u2019ve been talking about. We\u2019ll be right back. Maggie, let\u2019s now talk about this, as you said, second blueprint for Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2014 the message he\u2019s delivering at his rallies. You have been watching and, I assume, attending these rallies. Mostly watching, recently attending, yes. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump! OK, so let\u2019s start with how Trump addresses the legal questions that we have just been talking about. What exactly is the message he\u2019s delivering about all of this? So in fact, I was at a rally that he did at the end of December in New Hampshire. Every time the radical-left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor, because I am being indicted for you. Thank you very much. He has a bunch of familiar tactics that he uses. He tells his supporters that really, these prosecutors are after them. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they\u2019re not after me. They\u2019re after you. I just happen to be standing in the way, and I will always be \u2014 And because he\u2019s standing up for them, and he\u2019s just in the way. But he started wrapping that in new language. It\u2019s no wonder Biden and the far-left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary. They\u2019re willing to violate the US Constitution. Which is saying that actually, it\u2019s President Biden who is puppeteering all of this. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. He\u2019s a threat. And that Democrats are the real threat to this country. So you know, we talk about democracy, but the whole world is watching the persecution of a political opponent that\u2019s kicking his ass. It\u2019s an amazing thing. I want to zero in on something you just said, which is that Trump is now claiming Democrats are a threat to democracy. That, of course, is complicated \u2014 perhaps to many years, ironic \u2014 because Democrats, and not just Democrats, view Trump and what he did around the 2020 election, the very reason he\u2019s in so much legal trouble, as a direct threat to democracy. I mean, he tried to overturn a democratic election he didn\u2019t like the results of. So he\u2019s trying \u2014 and this seems quite strained \u2014 to flip that around and say, no, the real threat to democracy is President Biden, because his Justice Department has brought some of these cases. Correct. In Trump\u2019s telling, Trump has done nothing wrong, of course, and it\u2019s that President Biden has weaponized the federal justice system to go after a rival and is even controlling these state-based cases in Georgia and New York. For which there is no evidence. For which there is no evidence in any of it that President Biden is directing this. But it\u2019s a sign that Trump and his team know that what Democrats are saying about Trump as a threat to democracy is having some effect in terms of the public. Just explain that. The attacks on Trump and the description of Trump as a threat to democracy, his behavior ahead of January 6, 2021, the things he said about Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 these are not pluses with independent voters and some Republicans. And Trump\u2019s team is aware of that. And they are concerned about the general election and what those attacks could look like. And so Trump is doing what Trump does best, which is try to muddy the waters \u2014 Right. \u2014 and say, actually, it\u2019s the other guy doing this thing I\u2019m accused of doing, so that voters can\u2019t really tell the difference anymore. Got it. So for the most part, he\u2019s not really engaging with the cases brought against him. And like you said, he\u2019s using them as an opportunity to simply go after Biden. Exactly. Well, talk about the ways that Trump is going after Biden beyond a kind of reverse projection of his legal problems. So he wraps all of his discussions related to the court cases around an attack on Biden where Biden is weakest, which is on the economy. The next economic boom will begin the instant the world knows that crooked Joe Biden is gone and Donald J. Trump has won four more years as president of United States. And despite a lot of economic indicators looking good, we know that many people don\u2019t feel good about the economy. Things cost more. It\u2019s difficult to afford a home. When I was at a rally that he did in New Hampshire at the end of December, there was a screen over Trump\u2019s head where he showed the mortgage rate. The average monthly mortgage payment has gone from $1,746 under my administration to $3,322 today. But you can\u2019t get the money, so it doesn\u2019t matter. And the point there is, things were better when I was president. Put me back in office. You\u2019ll have more money in your wallet. As long as Joe Biden is in the White House, the American dream is dead. But all of that will change the minute the polls close on election night, 2024. It\u2019s a pitch to a lot of voters. The economy is a pretty basic fact in most presidential elections. But it could particularly appeal to independents or suburbanites who turned away from him. Right, so this is the part of the rally where he\u2019s not just thinking about becoming the nominee, which, as we\u2019ve talked about, through his strategy, he feels kind of assured of. He\u2019s now pitching himself to the full American electorate. That\u2019s right. And beyond the economy, he spends a lot of time railing against the state of the country, particularly so when he\u2019s talking about immigration and crime. You know, when they let \u2014 I think the real number is 15, 16 million people into our country \u2014 when they do that, we got a lot of work to do. And he made a pretty shocking statement at the New Hampshire rally. They\u2019re poisoning the blood of our country. That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve poison mental institutions and prisons all over the world, not just \u2014 He described undocumented immigrants as poisoning the blood of America. I just want to talk to you about that language. What do you think he was doing? Why was he doing it? How should we think about it? Well, it\u2019s language that echoes language used by Adolf Hitler. It is language that echoes fascists across history. It\u2019s pretty shocking to hear a front-runner for one of the two major parties in this country describing undocumented immigrants this way. And it invokes a blood purity that is the language used by white supremacists. And it was not the first time Trump said it, but it was Trump doubling down on it. And in a sense, it\u2019s in keeping with how Trump has, at times, campaigned and talked. You were at the beginning of Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 when he talked about immigrants from Mexico. It\u2019s very jarring to hear him do it eight years later. There is always an argument about whether Trump is actually intensifying his language or escalating his language. And he just objectively is. And I will direct and completely overhaul DOJ to investigate every radical, out-of-control, fake, crooked prosecutor in America, for their illegal, racist-in-reverse enforcement of the law. The language where he describes Black prosecutors who are investigating him as \u201creverse racists\u201d is pretty shocking. What he\u2019s really saying is they hate white people? Yes. For which there is no evidence. He\u2019s not being investigated because he\u2019s white. But it does play into his crowd. I think as he has gotten angrier and as he has become more embattled, he has become more emboldened in what he is saying. Right. More willing to take greater risks in the kind of extremeness of what he\u2019s willing to say. And ignore people who tell him that this could be very damaging to him down the road politically, and inciting to people who listen to it. When you think about everything we\u2019re talking about here, there\u2019s a kind of deja-vu-all-over-again quality. This is Trump\u2019s playbook, and it didn\u2019t work for him four years ago. He lost. So how should we think about why it might be more effective in 2024 than it was in 2020? I think the right way to think about the current campaign is that it\u2019s more like 2016 than 2020. Hmm. More like the first campaign, which he won, than the second, that he didn\u2019t. Correct. In 2020, enough of a percentage of Americans were really tired of Trump. They were tired of the drama. They were tired of the chaos. He had been president for four years. People wanted a change, and Trump lost. 2016 was the campaign where Trump ran as an outsider against someone who was basically running as an incumbent \u2014 Hillary Clinton, who was basically running as a continuation of President Obama. And Trump obviously beat her. This campaign, so far, feels more like 2016. And Trump is better running as an insurgent than an incumbent. And you\u2019re seeing that again. Right. And in a sense, he can run as an insurgent, even though he had been president, because he hasn\u2019t been president the past four years. Correct. And because of that, his playbook might be more effective than it was in 2020. Let me just synthesize everything that you have, I think, explained. At the end of the day, this is a campaign about victimhood. Does that feel right? I mean, Trump\u2019s victimhood, in his telling, and America\u2019s victimhood. Trump\u2019s telling voters that he\u2019s a victim of these court cases, and he\u2019s telling voters, he\u2019s telling America, that they are victims of Biden\u2019s policies. That\u2019s what 2024 is going to sound like in the hands of Donald Trump. And I guess the question, based on your reporting and your analysis, your understanding of this race, is \u2014 is that potentially a winning message? That is exactly what the landscape is for 2024. And the reason it could be a winning message \u2014 and again, who knows \u2014 is President Biden\u2019s numbers remain quite poor. If they get better, it might not be a winning message. If the economy gets better, and in ways that voters feel good about, it might not, but that\u2019s basically the message Trump feels he has. And he\u2019s going to push it endlessly. And let me ask you this. If Trump is convicted of something between now and the general election next November, does this framework therefore get reinforced and deepened and stronger? Or does it ultimately all actually kind of collapse? Because a conviction is a conviction, and Americans can\u2019t wrap their heads around a convicted person being their president. We are seeing data in our own polling, the paper\u2019s polling, that suggested that more Republicans, more Trump voters, don\u2019t think that he should be the nominee if he is convicted. It suggests to me that people had not really been tuning in to what was happening with Trump legally. They will be in 2024, and things may end up looking different. In other words, these court cases \u2014 and this is where we started \u2014 they really do matter. They really do matter. Well, Maggie, thank you very much. Michael, thank you. Over the past few days, Trump\u2019s legal problems have only mounted. The Secretary of State in Maine sought to remove Trump from the state\u2019s Republican primary ballot, citing his efforts to overturn the results of the last election. Maine joins Colorado, whose Supreme Court ruled a week earlier that Trump could be removed from the Republican ballot in that state for the same reason. For now, Trump remains on the ballot in both states, as the cases make their way through the appeals process and, many predict, all the way up to the US Supreme Court in the coming weeks. Tomorrow on \u201cThe Daily,\u201d we turn to the campaign strategy of President Biden. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Monday, Israel said that it would begin withdrawing several thousand troops from Gaza, at least temporarily, in what would be the most significant publicly announced pullback since the war began. Israel has been under growing pressure to de-escalate its presence in Gaza, but in describing the pullback, it said the decision was primarily driven by the need to restore normalcy to the Israeli economy, which has been hurt by the massive mobilization of reservists. Meanwhile, in a momentous ruling, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court has struck down a law passed last year by the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that was designed to reduce the court\u2019s own power. The law, which made it harder for the courts to overrule decisions made by government ministers, touched off mass protests across Israel and raised questions about the health of the country\u2019s democracy. In response to Monday\u2019s decision, Netanyahu\u2019s party rebuked the Supreme Court for issuing what it said was a divisive ruling during a time of war.

Include your name and location, or a request to remain anonymous. Letters may be edited. I\u2019m a mature job hunter and work (if I could find a job) in tech. I totally understand that the 20- and 30-something recruiters think that my cover letters should start with \u201cgreetings from Jurassic Park\u201d and that nobody wants to hire their mother. That said, I need/want to keep working, I\u2019m a respected angel investor and work closely with C-level techies who love and respect me and appreciate my experienced advice. I just had an appalling experience with a leading tech company. I absolutely love their product and saw that they were looking for a head of events. In my cover letter, I suggested that while they needed someone who fit their description, they also needed someone to do public relations and set up a speaker\u2019s bureau. I was rejected for the event gig. Ten days later, I looked at their website and they listed a job for a \u201cproduct communications lead.\u201d The job description is pretty clearly taken from my cover letter. While I asked to be considered for the gig, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. I have no doubt that I\u2019ll never hear from them. \u2014 Anonymous I\u2019m irritated and angry on your behalf. And I\u2019m also wholly unsurprised. This sort of thing happens all the time, which is why, in my experience, it\u2019s best not to give free information or advice to a potential employer before you\u2019re asked to do so. In a cover letter, informational interview or even more formal sit-down, I\u2019d recommend that you talk up your accomplishments and outline the ways in which you could best serve the company \u2014 why you\u2019d be an asset, and what you\u2019ve learned over the course of your career \u2014 and leave the advice giving for later on, ideally in written memo form. And even then, you can be vague, gesturing at the fact that you might have even more specifics to share as the interview process goes forward. I\u2019m not suggesting that you play coy; just keep some of your cards close to the vest. You\u2019ve worked hard enough, and long enough, that you don\u2019t need to be giving information away for free. And if I sound like I\u2019m scolding, or telling you that you did the \u201cwrong\u201d thing, let me just say this: I\u2019m not. I just want you to keep your competitive edge, especially in an industry that values younger people over older, and sometimes that means saying less than more. After I left a marketing communications position, a colleague took my name off the publications I created and promoted them as her own work. Since I produced them on company time, of course the copyright belongs to the company. I\u2019m wondering if I should preserve my reputation, though. Is there anything I should do now? \u2014 Anonymous Question for you: What do you mean when you say \u201cpreserve your reputation\u201d? Do you feel as if your colleague promoting your work as her own somehow damages your own standing in your professional community? That by not being properly credited, your work is not only overlooked but injured? That your work is, or will be, discounted by your former employer? Listen, I\u2019m not trying to downplay what your colleague has done \u2014 or is doing. It\u2019s crappy, and it\u2019s dishonest, and it demonstrates a lack of moral and professional integrity. But I\u2019m not hearing, at least in your brief recounting of the situation, any reason for you to worry about your reputation. But I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t have all the facts. What, for example, does it mean that your colleague \u201cpromoted\u201d your work as her own? Did she do this within the company, i.e., to superiors? Did she do it to outside clients and partners?

Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign this weekend, appeared to end the possibility that President Biden would not be on the state\u2019s ballot in November. The Ohio General Assembly has passed a legislative fix that ensures President Biden will be on the state\u2019s ballot in November, averting a crisis that had been brewing for weeks over what is typically a minor procedural issue. The secretary of state in Ohio, a Republican, had said that he planned to exclude Mr. Biden from the ballot because the president would not be officially nominated by his party until after a state deadline for certifying presidential nominees. That had threatened the possibility that the president would not be on the ballot in all 50 states. The General Assembly resolved the issue by passing a bill that pushes back the deadline to accommodate the date of the Democratic nominating convention. Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill over the weekend, pending a legal review, according to a spokesman. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Soma Golden Behr, a longtime senior editor at The New York Times who was a centrifuge of story ideas \u2014 they flew out of her in all directions \u2014 and whose journalistic passions were poverty, race and class, which led to reporting that won Pulitzer Prizes, died on Sunday in Manhattan. She was 84. Her husband, William A. Behr, said her death, in the palliative care unit of Mount Sinai Hospital, came after breast cancer had spread to other organs. Ms. Golden Behr, whose economics degree from Radcliffe led to a lifetime interest in issues involving inequality, was instrumental in overseeing several major series for The Times that examined class and racial divides. Each enlisted squads of reporters, photographers and editors for intensive, sometimes yearlong assignments. \u201cHow Race Is Lived in America,\u201d overseen with Gerald M. Boyd, who would become The Times\u2019s first Black managing editor, peeled away the conventional wisdom that the country at the turn of the 21st century had become \u201cpost-racial.\u201d Its deep dives into an integrated church, the military, a slaughterhouse and elsewhere won the paper the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in 2001. Another series, \u201cClass in America,\u201d published in 2005, was an examination of how social class, often unspoken, produced glaring imbalances in society. Both the race and the class series were subsequently published as books. Earlier, in 1993, Ms. Golden Behr had overseen a 10-part series, \u201cChildren of the Shadows,\u201d which pushed past stereotypes of young people in inner cities.

  "2025-04-26_162914_1": "The prosecution accused him of colluding with U.S. officials to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s interests, citing private messages, meetings and social media posts. Reporting from Hong Kong Jimmy Lai, a veteran pro-democracy figure in Hong Kong, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to national security charges, as prosecutors accused him of colluding with American and other foreign officials to destabilize the city and undermine China\u2019s sovereignty. Mr. Lai, 76, who founded Apple Daily, a popular antigovernment newspaper, was arrested in 2020, becoming one of the first prominent targets of a national security law imposed by Beijing to crush the opposition. Mr. Lai faces up to life in prison if convicted of national security offenses, and his trial is seen as a test of the independence of the city\u2019s judiciary. As Mr. Lai, who was wearing a navy blazer and a white shirt, entered the courtroom, he smiled and waved to his wife and three of his children, who sat in the gallery, before taking his seat in a dock encased by glass. On Tuesday, the lead prosecutor, Anthony Chau, began making his case by outlining evidence of what he described as Mr. Lai\u2019s collusion with foreign forces, a vaguely defined political crime under the national security law. Mr. Chau\u2019s argument centered on meetings Mr. Lai had with American politicians, messages he had exchanged with officials, interviews he gave to the media, and views that he aired on social media. He presented a diagram mapping out what he described as Mr. Lai\u2019s foreign political connections, with whom he had met in 2019, including officials in the Trump administration such as the then-vice president, Mike Pence, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, as well as other politicians such as Nancy Pelosi, who had been Speaker of the House. Mr. Chau accused Mr. Lai of undermining national security by calling on the American officials to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials responsible for the crackdown on the city\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. Such an act has been deemed a \u201chostile activity\u201d against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments and is an offense under the national security law. Mr. Chau described Mr. Lai as a \u201cradical political figure who conspired with others to bring in hatred and stir up opposition.\u201d Mr. Chau said that Mr. Lai\u2019s former employees at Apple Daily and Next Digital, which owns Apple Daily, would testify against him in the trial.

The victory by Mr. Hamadeh in the district, which encompasses suburbs north and west of Phoenix, came after an unusual last-minute turn in the race: Mr. Trump endorsed both candidates the weekend before the primary, effectively declaring that he had no preference for who won.

  "2025-04-26_914817_1": "What to Watch Supported by The Doctor saves a rich wannabe vlogger from being eaten by a giant slug, but a final twist leaves him reeling. Isobel Lewis has been watching \u201cDoctor Who\u201d since 2005. As a teenager, she made GIFs of the show for her fan Tumblr. We\u2019ve passed the midway point in this season of \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d and the show\u2019s ambition shows no sign of subsiding. After playing with themes of religion and politics, it\u2019s artificial intelligence, already touched on in the earlier episode \u201cBoom,\u201d that\u2019s the topic du jour in \u201cDot and Bubble.\u201d With its slick visuals and clear anti-technology viewpoint, Episode 5 has echoes of \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d Charlie Brooker\u2019s dystopian TV anthology \u2014 as this season\u2019s showrunner, Russell T Davies, who also wrote the episode, noted in a recent interview. But whereas Brooker can use each episode of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d to focus on a different aspect of contemporary technology, Davies has just 43 minutes to explore its overarching morality in \u201cDot and Bubble.\u201d It makes for a slightly overstuffed episode \u2014 critiquing and parodying capitalism, YouTube and celebrity worship \u2014 that is saved, in part, by a genuinely unexpected twist in the final act. As with the previous episode, \u201c73 Yards,\u201d the Doctor doesn\u2019t feature all that heavily in \u201cDot and Bubble\u201d and the action feels less consequential to the season\u2019s overall arc. Instead, the focus is on Lindy Pepper-Bean (Callie Cooke), a blonde-haired, blue-eyed wannabe vlogger with a penchant for pastels. Lindy\u2019s life revolves around a two-part technology: Dot, a tiny robotic pearl that hovers in front of her, and Bubble, a virtual sphere of colorful screens beamed around her head. Within the Bubble, the perpetually peppy Lindy is in constant conversation with her friends; she chats away with the cadence \u2014 and vocal fry \u2014 of a family-friendly YouTuber, and they coo back.

  "2025-04-26_8799_1": "Supported by \u201cHe has an energy that\u2019s fun to hate,\u201d the British actor said of his swaggering vampire character in AMC\u2019s series-length Anne Rice adaptation. This interview contains spoilers for the Season 2 finale of \u201cInterview With the Vampire.\u201d Until his time in AMC\u2019s \u201cInterview With the Vampire\u201d was cut short \u2014 along with his head \u2014 in the Season 2 finale, Santiago was the toast of the vampiric theater scene. Played by the British actor Ben Daniels, himself an Olivier Award-winning veteran of the stage, Santiago was a dashing and devilish performer at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vampires, in postwar Paris. Formerly known as Francis, a failed English actor, Santiago transformed himself into an underworld dandy after becoming a bloodsucker \u2014 and took a cooler-sounding name \u2014 rarely seen without a vampiress on each arm and a theatrically hateful twinkle in his eye. \u201cHe\u2019s so awful and delicious at the same time!\u201d Daniels said in a video interview last week. \u201cAnd it\u2019s his relish of it as well, his glee. He just loves being a vampire.\u201d Daniels added: \u201cHe has an energy that\u2019s fun to hate.\u201d Unfortunately for Santiago, the show\u2019s title vampire was his hater-in-chief. Over the course of Season 2, which concluded on Sunday, Santiago seized control of the theater troupe, which turned out to be a coven of vampires in disguise. At the season\u2019s climax, Santiago staged a mock trial that ended with the real execution-by-sunlight of Claudia (Delainey Hayles) and her companion, Madeleine (Roxane Duran). It was for this crime that Santiago lost his head to their father figure, the vampire Louis (Jacob Anderson), in the finale. Based on the novels of Anne Rice\u2019s Vampire Chronicles series, the AMC show, created and overseen by Rolin Jones, has already been renewed for a third season. But Daniels doesn\u2019t feel too bad that his character won\u2019t live to see Season 3. Santiago had it coming given his bad behavior \u2014 particularly by the end. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want him dead before,\u201d Daniels said, \u201cyou certainly do then.\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

  "2025-04-26_205928_1": "Trump Administration Supported by While Donald J. Trump has attacked California as too liberal for the nation, Gov. Gavin Newsom has vetoed several bills that could have become political fodder. Reporting from Sacramento For much of the past year, conservatives have considered Gov. Gavin Newsom of California a perfect symbol of liberal excess, a well-coifed coastal governor with national aspirations whose state seemed to embrace undocumented immigrants while homeless encampments proliferated on the streets. It was Mr. Newsom who was invited to debate Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida on Fox News last November. It was Mr. Newsom whose political action committee ran ads in Republican states to criticize their policies on abortion rights. But Mr. Newsom, a business owner, often governs more from the middle than his critics acknowledge. And over the past month, as he has sifted through hundreds of bills that the heavily Democratic Legislature sent his way to sign or veto by this Monday, his decisions indicate a more centrist shift than usual. With Vice President Kamala Harris, a former senator from California, in a hotly contested race for the White House, Republicans have aimed a spotlight on her and Mr. Newsom\u2019s home state. As such, the governor has been under pressure to make sure that California\u2019s lawmakers don\u2019t give them more ammunition for political attacks. Mr. Newsom approved many measures that were in keeping with what most Americans would expect in California. There were big bills to address the state\u2019s ongoing housing crisis; labor bills to protect the earnings of child influencers and the likenesses of Hollywood performers; and an outright ban on all plastic bags at retail stores. There was legislation to name the Dungeness crab as the official state crustacean, the banana slug as the official slug, and the black abalone as the official seashell. There was a bill pushed by celebrities like Woody Harrelson and Whoopi Goldberg that will allow Amsterdam-style \u201ccannabis cafes\u201d to open.There was a measure that will require health insurers to cover infertility treatment, including in vitro fertilization, as Democrats have attacked Republicans nationally for restricting access to fertility services.

At a community meeting, residents called the killing \u201can injustice.\u201d Reporting from Utica, N.Y. More than 100 residents of Utica, N.Y., grieving the death of a 13-year-old boy who was fatally shot by a police officer there last week, gathered at a church on Sunday afternoon to demand accountability for his killing. The boy, Nyah Mway, was walking in the city with another boy on Friday night when they were stopped by three police officers. When one officer asked to pat them down, Nyah fled, footage from officers\u2019 body-worn cameras shows. The police said in a statement that Nyah had displayed \u201cwhat appeared to be a handgun\u201d as he ran. In footage that has been slowed down, it appears that he turns while holding something that looks like a handgun, before he is tackled, held to the ground and shot. The police later determined that he had been holding a pellet gun. On Sunday, the mayor of Utica, Michael P. Galime, answered questions from residents who filled the auditorium at Tabernacle Baptist Church. Police officials were not in attendance. Almost all of the attendees were part of the city\u2019s Karen community \u2014 members of an ethnic group from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, who speak the Karen language.

Pragati K.B. reported from New Delhi. Exhausted doctors resting in crowded on-call rooms with no locks, two to a single bed. Frustrated relatives of patients angrily challenging a physician\u2019s diagnosis. Too few security guards to keep the peace. These are everyday realities in Indian government hospitals. Young doctors describe multiday shifts and harrowing working conditions in rooms and wards often lacking in safety and hygiene, where learning is frequently interrupted by the crushing load of urgent cases. Their plight has come to light in recent weeks after the rape and murder in Kolkata of a 31-year-old junior doctor who had been resting after a grueling 36-hour shift. Last month, the police arrested a man, considered a prime suspect in the killing, after he was caught on CCTV walking into the hospital late at night. The case has prompted nationwide protests, with doctors, students and human rights activists demanding justice for the victim, as well as better protection and safer workplaces for doctors and women. Many doctors also went on strike. \u201cPeople protested because we identified with the victim,\u201d said Dr. Susmita Sengupta, who graduated in 2020 from M.G.M.

  "2025-04-26_383462_1": "Newsletter The changing economy has made federal debt a bigger problem. The federal debt starts the new year at a level that is hard to grasp: $34 trillion. That is 1.2 times the U.S.\u2019s annual economic output. At the end of World War II, the ratio was only about 1.1. Both parties have contributed to the situation. Republicans have passed large tax cuts. Democrats have enacted ambitious climate and health care initiatives. Both funneled money to Americans in response to the Covid pandemic. For years, many economists believed the country\u2019s debt was not a problem. Interest rates were low, which held down debt payments. Inflation was also low, which suggested the debt wasn\u2019t hampering the economy. If anything, additional government spending helped create jobs when unemployment was elevated for much of the 2010s. But times have changed, and federal deficits now look scarier. In November, the financial firm Moody\u2019s lowered its outlook on U.S. debt from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative.\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that she disagreed with Moody\u2019s decision, but she acknowledged that current economic circumstances could make the federal debt less sustainable. And Paul Krugman, the economist and Times columnist, wrote, \u201cSerious deficit reduction, a bad idea a decade ago, is a good idea now.\u201d July 2023 120% 100% Debt equal to G.D.P. 50 1980 2000 2023 July 2023 120% 100% Debt equal to G.D.P. 50 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2023 Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Today\u2019s newsletter will help you think about the new economics of debt. There are three big reasons to worry about the federal government\u2019s finances. First, interest rates have risen. A decade ago, the interest rate that the U.S. paid on inflation-protected bonds, which are used to finance debt, was near zero. Today, that rate is almost 2 percent. This increase doesn\u2019t change the cost of debt that the government has already accumulated. But it will have to pay more interest on future debt. So if the government does not hold down spending, debt payments will increasingly eat up money that could go to health care, the military and other programs. Second, the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent. In the early 2010s, it was usually above 8 percent. Back then, government spending helped put people to work. Today, the private sector needs less help. Third, inflation is a bigger problem than it used to be, and higher deficits could make it worse. When Congress spends more or cuts taxes, Americans have more money to spend. As they spend that extra cash, prices tend to increase. The reverse is true as well: A smaller deficit can ease inflation. All of which means that the benefits of deficit spending are smaller than they were in the recent past and the costs are larger. Both parties have offered partial solutions to the growing debt. Democrats favor higher taxes on the rich, and Republicans favor cuts to Medicaid and some other federal programs. But each party has mostly blocked the other\u2019s proposals, allowing deficits to add to the debt year after year. Even if the preferred policies of each party eventually are enacted, they do not come close to solving the problem. Neither party is willing to cut the biggest government programs: Social Security, Medicare and the military. And both have ruled out tax increases on most households. This dynamic \u2014 politicians criticizing deficits without offering a real solution \u2014 is not new. The shifting economic circumstances, however, could make the gridlock more damaging. There is also a risk to procrastination: The longer the government puts off the issue, the harder it gets to solve. By acting sooner, officials could phase in higher taxes and lower spending over years to mitigate the downsides. Some experts argue that the country is already past that point. \u201cWe put off solutions for too long, and now we\u2019ll have to take more drastic action,\u201d Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told me. The solution remains unclear. And the economy may be able to continue growing at a steady clip for years despite the debt. At some point, though, the federal government will likely need to raise taxes and cut spending in ways that many Americans will find unpleasant. Related: \u201cThe Daily\u201d explained why any political party will find it tough to tackle the federal debt. \u201cThe ideas that smart people have on the table are at best Hail Marys,\u201d Jim Tankersley, an economic policy correspondent, said. Israel\u2019s Supreme Court struck down a divisive law passed by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government to limit the judges\u2019 powers.

Japanese officials warned people to brace for aftershocks after a powerful earthquake collapsed buildings and cut off power. A Japan Airlines plane burst into flames at an airport in Tokyo. It reportedly collided with a Coast Guard plane. Russia hammered Kyiv with missiles during a large attack across the country. Businesses in India are hesitating to make long-term investments in part because of concerns about politics. China is pressuring women to have more babies. Many are saying no, The Wall Street Journal reports. Buses dropped migrants at train stations in New Jersey to sidestep an order meant to stop arrivals in New York City from Texas and elsewhere. Debates on A.I., gender and guns look likely to dominate state legislatures in 2024. As people watch the Israel-Hamas war unfold, they describe being empathetic to the point of exhaustion. What they\u2019re actually feeling is helpless, Adam Grant writes. Ruti Munder, a woman Hamas held hostage, will never return to Gaza, or have peace with Gazans, while Hamas remains in power.

  "2025-04-26_735094_1": "Trump Administration Supported by Donald Trump disavowed the set of conservative plans after it became a popular target for Democrats, but his running mate, JD Vance, wrote a foreword for a forthcoming book by its principal architect. Even as Donald J. Trump is trying to distance himself from the Heritage Foundation-led Project 2025, his running mate\u2019s contribution to a new book by the project\u2019s principal architect is complicating his efforts. \u201cDawn\u2019s Early Light,\u201d a forthcoming book by the Heritage Foundation\u2019s president, Kevin D. Roberts, calling for a \u201csecond American Revolution,\u201d features a foreword by Senator JD Vance, the Ohio Republican whom Mr. Trump tapped as his running mate in July. \u201cIn the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon,\u201d Mr. Vance writes in his introduction, which was obtained and published online by The New Republic on Tuesday. The book is set for publication in September. Mr. Vance announced in June that he had written the foreword for Mr. Roberts, whose think tank became an influential bastion of conservative policymaking during Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency and enjoyed exceptional influence during Mr. Trump\u2019s time in office, providing a staffing pipeline for his administration. But Mr. Vance\u2019s endorsement of the book became more politically fraught after Mr. Trump publicly disavowed Project 2025, a set of sweeping policy proposals for a hoped-for Republican presidency that the think tank began preparing more than two years ago under Mr. Roberts\u2019s direction. The project, which has been billed by Heritage as an attack on the \u201cdeep state\u201d and proposes disbanding multiple federal agencies, excluding abortion from health care and ending an array of climate change programs, has become a popular target for Democrats. Will Martin, a spokesman for Mr. Vance, wrote in an email Wednesday that \u201cthe foreword has nothing to do with Project 2025.\u201d Mr. Vance \u201chas plenty of disagreements with what they\u2019re calling for,\u201d Mr. Martin wrote, adding: \u201cOnly President Trump will set the policy agenda for the next administration.\u201d In a July 5 post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump wrote that he knew \u201cnothing\u201d about Project 2025 and its authors. \u201cI disagree with some of the things they\u2019re saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,\u201d he wrote. In a Fox News interview last week, he described its architects as \u201ca group of very, very conservative people,\u201d some of whose ambitions were \u201cabsolutely ridiculous.\u201d There is no evidence that Mr. Trump has been directly involved in Project 2025, which Heritage began in April 2022, months before Mr. Trump announced his 2024 campaign. The think tank has drawn up aspirational policy blueprints for incoming Republican presidencies since Mr. Reagan was elected in 1980 \u2014 though Project 2025\u2019s flagship document, the 922-page \u201cMandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,\u201d is more extensive than its predecessors. But Mr. Roberts presented Project 2025 as a direct response to the frustrations of Mr. Trump and his inner circle to the resistance and legal roadblocks their agenda faced in some quarters of the federal government during his presidency \u2014 an experience that has informed Mr. Trump and his advisers\u2019 plans to overhaul federal staffing should he be re-elected in November. Early in the project, the organization hired several veterans of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration who were involved in directing both policy and hiring personnel. The Daily Signal, Heritage\u2019s online publication, described the project as a \u201cfour-point game plan for a conservative president to dismantle the deep state that undermined Trump.\u201d In recent months, Democrats, including both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on the campaign trail, have seized on Project 2025 as a talking point, presenting it as evidence that a second Trump presidency would be more radical in its vision than the first, and more effective in enacting it. Mr. Roberts further fueled the attention in early July when he remarked on the former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast that the United States was \u201cin the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\u201d The attacks on the project have apparently gained enough traction with voters to prompt Mr. Trump\u2019s disavowal. The former president\u2019s statements have left Heritage in a complicated position. In an onstage interview at a Heritage event at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, Paul Dans, the director of Project 2025 and the co-editor of \u201cMandate for Leadership,\u201d complained that liberals had mischaracterized the project. He called the criticism of it \u201cProjection 2025.\u201d \u201cThe people who are screaming the loudest about it,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re really the ones defending the deep state. They\u2019re defending the end of democracy.\u201d But he did not address Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks, and Heritage announced this week that Mr. Dans would be leaving his position. In response to the news, the Trump campaign said in a statement that \u201creports of Project 2025\u2019s demise would be greatly welcomed.\u201d Mr. Roberts\u2019s book is the latest Heritage-related project to be caught up in the maelstrom, in large part because of the connection to Mr. Vance. The Biden and, later, Harris campaign has released statements and heavily edited video clips falsely suggesting Mr. Vance has endorsed Project 2025. Crystal Bonham, a spokeswoman for the organization, said that Project 2025 was mentioned only once, briefly, in \u201cDawn\u2019s Early Light,\u201d which she characterized as a long-range conservative policy vision mixed with Mr. Roberts\u2019s own story of growing up in difficult circumstances in Lafayette, La. But in recent weeks, Mr. Roberts\u2019s publisher, Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of Harper Collins, pulled offline a digital advance copy of the book that had been available for download for book reviewers and booksellers, and the book\u2019s publication may be delayed. Broadside has also dropped the original subtitle, \u201cBurning Down Washington to Save America,\u201d and cover art featuring a charred match, and has toned down similarly incendiary promotional language for the book. Ms. Bonham said the changes were made at Heritage\u2019s request after the attempted assassination of Mr. Trump on July 13, though they had been discussed earlier. \u201cThis was in the spirit of lowering the temperature of politics right now and getting back to constructive conversations around policy and the future of the country,\u201d she said. There had been no discussion of removing or altering Mr. Vance\u2019s foreword, Ms. Bonham said. Mr. Vance wrote a preface to a Heritage report in 2017, several years before Mr. Roberts took the helm at the organization. The two met and bonded over the course of a two-hour conversation shortly after Mr. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022, Ms. Bonham said, comparing notes on their similar upbringings and policy views. Mr. Roberts happened to be holding a news conference on July 15, at Heritage\u2019s Republican convention event, when Mr. Trump announced that Mr. Vance would be his running mate. \u201cYou will see a broad smile on my face,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAs you may know, we are good friends.\u201d Vance, he said, was \u201csomeone that privately we were really rooting for.\u201d Charles Homans is a reporter for The Times and The Times Magazine, covering national politics.

But are there really any cool heads left? \u201cWe read fantasy to find the colors again, I think,\u201d George R.R. Martin wrote in his short 1996 essay \u201cOn Fantasy.\u201d \u201cTo taste strong spices and hear the songs the sirens sang.\u201d By that standard, this week\u2019s episode of \u201cHouse of the Dragon,\u201d a series based on Martin\u2019s book \u201cFire and Blood,\u201d is spicy fantasy indeed. I don\u2019t just mean the sex and nudity, though what there was of both blew my hair back on my head. For Martin, fantasy is about more than ribaldry. Describing it as a genre of \u201csilver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold and lapis lazuli,\u201d he goes on to write of how its very largeness, the unbounded scope of its imagination, \u201cspeaks to something deep within us.\u201d This episode certainly spoke to something deep within this critic. Crumbling gothic castles and grotesque charnel-house battlefields, nightmares of murder and desperate pleas for peace, breakneck dragon chases and it-was-all-a-big-misunderstandings \u2014 this week offered the kind of maximalist storytelling that felt both over-the-top and vital. (Indeed it\u2019s hard to have great TV without at least a smidgen of the outlandish.) From a story perspective, the episode\u2019s biggest moment arrived right near the end. The brewing war between the Blacks and the Greens over the Iron Throne comes down to the wishes of one dead man, King Viserys. For years, he proclaimed his daughter, Rhaenyra, to be his heir to all and sundry. But on the night it most counted, the night of his death, he told his wife, Queen Alicent, that his eldest son, Aegon, must be the one to unite the realm \u2014 \u201cThe Prince That Was Promised,\u201d as Viserys called the callow lad. Or so it seemed to Alicent. We in the audience knew that when he mentioned the name Aegon, he was referring to his prophetic ancestor, Aegon the Conqueror, and to Aegon\u2019s vision of an apocalyptic battle against the darkness, as depicted in the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Did Alicent truly believe that Viserys was talking about their son? Or was that merely what she wished to believe? (As important, should a drama hinge its central conflict on the kind of verbal mix-up better suited to a sitcom? Answering that is, at this advanced stage, perhaps beyond the scope of this recap.) The daring stealth mission in which Rhaenyra sneaks back into King\u2019s Landing (with Mysaria\u2019s help) to force a one-on-one meeting with her frenemy of frenemies clears all this up. Alicent really believes Viserys wanted Aegon. For her part, Rhaenyra really believes Alicent really believes it. But once the dowager queen mentions the Conqueror\u2019s \u201cSong of Ice and Fire,\u201d Rhaenyra figures out what went wrong and offers a clarification \u2026 which Alicent refuses to heed, although she seems to know in her heart that it is true.

Supported by Photographs by Marian Carrasquero Reporting from Maracaibo, Venezuela It was once a thriving metropolis in the heart of oil country in Venezuela. That city, Maracaibo, no longer exists. Today, the city is rife with abandoned houses, some of which look like bombs were dropped on them, because homeowners tore windows and roofs off to sell for scrap before they took off on journeys to Colombia, Chile and the United States. Middle-class neighborhoods are filled with for sale signs and overgrown yards. Fewer cars drive down the streets, and fewer criminals are around to steal them. Christmas dinners, once packed with noisy relatives, are lonely affairs aided by webcams. Nearly eight million people \u2014 more than a quarter of the population \u2014 have fled Venezuela in recent years, driven out by economic misery and political repression. Nowhere is that exodus more staggeringly acute than in Maracaibo, which has been hollowed out by the loss of about half a million of its 2.2 million inhabitants \u2014 many of them adults in their late teens to middle age.

Reporting from Houston Vice President Kamala Harris carefully hit back at former President Donald J. Trump after he questioned the legitimacy of her identity as a Black woman, saying on Wednesday that he had put on the \u201csame old show\u201d of \u201cdivisiveness and disrespect.\u201d \u201cThe American people deserve better,\u201d Ms. Harris said at a convention of Sigma Gamma Rho, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent Black sororities. \u201cThe American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us \u2014 they are an essential source of our strength.\u201d But she did not directly quote or refer to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments earlier on Wednesday in Chicago, where he had asked of Ms. Harris: \u201cIs she Indian or is she Black?\u201d He had also falsely claimed that Ms. Harris used to identify as Indian and then \u201call of a sudden, she made a turn, and she became a Black person.\u201d The vice president is of Jamaican and Indian heritage, and attended Howard University, a historically Black university. Ms. Harris\u2019s precisely calibrated rebuttal was perhaps an early indication of how she will respond to crude and racist attacks from Mr. Trump. Former President Barack Obama largely ignored Republicans, led by Mr. Trump, who falsely accused him of being born in Kenya. Her remarks on Wednesday came after she has sought to place her campaign on the continuum of racial progress in America, referring to it in the same breath as abolitionists and civil rights activists. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom,\u201d Ms. Harris said during a Tuesday night rally there. \u201cNow the baton is in our hands.\u201d Ms. Harris is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, which along with Sigma Gamma Rho is one of the \u201cDivine Nine,\u201d a group of distinguished Black sororities and fraternities that has rushed to mobilize voters on her behalf. Her replacing Mr. Biden on top of the ticket has energized many Democrats, including African Americans. Mr. Trump had been making gains among Black voters. His comments \u2014 made during an appearance at a convention of Black journalists in Chicago \u2014 seemed to serve as an attempt to drive a wedge between those voters and Ms. Harris. At a fund-raiser in Maine on Wednesday, Doug Emhoff, Ms. Harris\u2019s husband, said the former president\u2019s comments showed \u201ca lack of character\u201d but were ultimately a \u201cdistraction.\u201d And Asha\u2019 Jones, a member of Sigma Gamma Rho who attended the event in Houston, said such attacks on Ms. Harris were beneath contempt. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to prove her Blackness to anybody,\u201d said Ms. Jones, 47, a Democrat. \u201cShe understands who she is.\u201d Several attendees, all wearing the sorority\u2019s traditional gold jackets, approvingly quoted the words of Michelle Obama, the former first lady: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d Ms. Harris seemed to echo that sentiment in the conclusion of her speech. \u201cLet us continue to fight with faith, with optimism and with hope,\u201d she said.

Supported by Theater Review The \u201cOppenheimer\u201d star makes his Broadway debut in Ayad Akhtar\u2019s timely new play about a literary lion who gets assistance from A.I. The Vivian Beaumont Theater has, over the years, been memorably transformed into many specific, even exotic, locales: a Maine carousel, a Thai palace, a South Pacific Seabee base. But never has it looked more exotically nowhere than it does right now, as the setting for Ayad Akhtar\u2019s \u201cMcNeal,\u201d a thought experiment about art and A.I. With its softly rounded edges, cool colors and shifting screens, the sleek, vast space is as much an Apple store as a stage. That\u2019s only fitting for a story, set in \u201cthe very near future,\u201d in which computer-mediated interactions \u2014 predictive chatbots, large language models, generative intelligence \u2014 are pitted against their analog forebears. What creative opportunities does such technology afford the artist? What human opportunities does it squander? Forget the sword: It\u2019s the pen vs. the pixel. I\u2019m afraid, alas, the pixel wins, because the play, which opened on Monday, in a stylish Lincoln Center Theater production directed by Bartlett Sher, works only as provocation. Timely but turgid, it rarely rises to drama; in a neat recapitulation of current fears about technology, its humans, hardly credible as such, have been almost entirely replaced by ideas. Certainly Jacob McNeal, played by the formidable Robert Downey Jr., is more a data set than a character. A manly, hard-driving literary novelist of the old school, like Saul Bellow or Philip Roth, he is not at all the magnetic and personable man Akhtar describes in the script; rather, he is whiny, entitled and fatuous. (\u201cAt my simple best, I\u2019m a poet,\u201d he says.) About the only time he engages instead of repels is when, in the amusing opening scene, as his doctor (Ruthie Ann Miles) prepares to deliver bad news, he fails to get ChatGPT to tell him his chances of winning the Nobel Prize. \u201cI hope this was helpful,\u201d the bot types. \u201cIt was not, you soulless, silicon suck-up,\u201d he replies. We are meant to understand that McNeal is a man who wears his awfulness, in this case his vanity, as an adorable idiosyncrasy, as if it were a feathered hat. He flirts and philanders with equal obliviousness to moral implications. He aggressively asserts his anti-woke bona fides. While being interviewed by a New York Times journalist, who is Black, he asks if she was a \u201cdiversity hire.\u201d And when she fails to take the bait, he adds, as a man of his sophistication would know enough not to, \u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Bilar Shbair reported from Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip. Health workers on Sunday began a polio vaccination drive in Gaza aimed at preventing an outbreak of the quick-spreading disease \u2014 a daunting challenge in a besieged enclave shattered by 10 months of war and dependent on commitments by Israel and Hamas to abide by pledged \u201chumanitarian pauses.\u201d Israel, facing international pressure to prevent a wider outbreak of the crippling disease, moved with relative speed to allow agencies of the United Nations, supported by local health officials, to tackle the crisis in Gaza, where it launched a war in response to a Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7. Although the vaccination drive officially began early Sunday, Gazan health authorities gave some doses to children on Saturday at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to reports in Palestinian news media. Videos showed doctors and health workers squeezing droplets of the poliovirus vaccine into the mouths of children who were being treated at the hospital. \u201cI knew about this campaign by chance. I was frightened when I heard the word polio,\u201d said Maysaa Abu Daqqa, a mother of a 9-year-old, Habib Nizam.

With much of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure destroyed, and some 90 percent of the enclave\u2019s roughly two million residents having repeatedly fled Israeli bombardment, it may be impossible to ensure the immunization of all of the enclave\u2019s estimated 640,000 children under age 10. \u201cThis is a race against time,\u201d Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the main U.N. agency in charge of aiding Palestinians, said in a post on X.

  "2025-04-26_819445_1": "Middle East Tensions Supported by News Analysis The killing of Hamas\u2019s political leader in Tehran was a humiliating security failure for the Iranian government. Most new Iranian presidents have months to settle into the decades-old cadence of gradual nuclear escalation, attacks against adversaries and, episodically, secret talks with the West to relieve sanctions. President Masoud Pezeshkian had 10 hours. That was the elapsed time between his swearing-in and the explosion inside an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps guesthouse, at 2 a.m. in Tehran, that killed Ismail Haniyeh, the longtime political leader of Hamas. Mr. Haniyeh had not only attended the swearing-in, but had also been embraced by the new president and met that day with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, making the assassination a particularly brazen act. Now Mr. Pezeshkian \u2014 along with Ayatollah Khamenei and top military generals \u2014 will be immersed in critical choices that may determine whether war breaks out between two of the Mideast\u2019s most potent militaries. He spent his first day in office in national security meetings. The final decision on how to retaliate rests with Mr. Khamenei and on Wednesday he where ordered Iranian forces to strike Israel directly for what appeared to be its role in killing Mr. Haniyeh. But how that retaliation unfolds makes a difference. If Iran launches direct missile attacks, as it attempted for the first time in 45 years in April, the cycle of strike and counterstrike could easily escalate. If Hezbollah, its closest ally in the region, steps up attacks on Israel\u2019s north or the Houthis expand their attacks in the Red Sea, the war could expand to Lebanon, or involve the need for American naval forces to keep the sea lanes open. Behind all of those options is perhaps the riskiest choice of all: whether Iran decides to take the final step toward building an actual nuclear weapon. For decades it has walked right up to the line, producing nuclear fuel and in recent years enriching it to near bomb-grade levels. But American intelligence assessments say the country has always stopped short of an actual weapon, a decision Iranian leaders have publicly been reconsidering in recent months.

Trump was found guilty, he and a number of conservative figures in the news media and lawmakers on the right have spread false and misleading claims about the Manhattan case. Reporting from Washington After former President Donald J. Trump was found guilty of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, he instantly rejected the verdict and assailed the judge and criminal justice system.

  "2025-04-26_780950_1": "Artificial Intelligence DealBook Newsletter From elections and A.I. to antitrust and shadow banking, here are the big themes that could define the worlds of business and policy. Andrew here. As we look ahead to the new year, the DealBook team has identified about a dozen themes that are likely to become running narratives that could define the business and policy ecosystem for the next 12 months. Of course, the presidential election, perhaps one of the most polarizing in history, is going to infect every part of the business world. Watch out for which C.E.O.s and other financiers back candidates \u2014 and, importantly, which ones go silent \u2014 and how companies deal with outspoken employees. Also: Look for some wealthy executives to avoid giving directly to candidates but instead donate to PACs as a shield, of sorts, from public scrutiny. Another story line that will probably remain part of the water cooler \u2014 er, Slack and X \u2014 conversation in business is the backlash against environmental, social and corporate governance principles, or E.S.G. This fight has manifested itself into a political battle and increasingly found its way in the past year into a debate about free speech on campuses (another theme that isn\u2019t going away). Here\u2019s a bit more detail on what we\u2019re looking out for this year. The U.S. presidential election. The race seems set to come down to a rerun of 2020, with Donald Trump leading opinion polls to be the Republican candidate despite his mounting legal battles. The big question is how business leaders will respond. Will they coalesce around (and direct their money to) an anyone-but-Trump candidate? Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, is leading that race, but she has a long way to go to catch up to Trump. President Biden, who has made a series of consequential decisions on the economy, hopes voters will start to feel an economic upswing to reverse his sagging poll ratings. Private credit could be hit by a wave of defaults. Just as 1980s-style leveraged buyouts have been rechristened \u201cprivate equity,\u201d so too has \u201cshadow banking\u201d been rebranded as \u201cprivate credit\u201d and \u201cdirect lending\u201d in time for the business to reach its highest levels yet. Direct lending by investment firms and hedge funds has become a $1.5 trillion titan, with scores of companies turning to the likes of Apollo and Ares for loans instead of, say, JPMorgan Chase. But the industry may face a test in 2024: Indebted borrowers, facing looming debt maturities and high interest rates, already are turning to private credit for yet more loans, raising concerns that lenders could face a wave of defaulting clients. A string of failures could hit these lenders hard, skeptics fear \u2014 leaving pension funds, insurers and other backers of private credit funds holding the bag.

By Claire Cain Miller and Sarah Mervosh The pandemic\u2019s babies, toddlers and preschoolers are now school-age, and the impact on them is becoming increasingly clear: Many are showing signs of being academically and developmentally behind. Interviews with more than two dozen teachers, pediatricians and early childhood experts  depicted a generation less likely to have age-appropriate skills \u2014 to be able to hold a pencil, communicate their needs, identify shapes and letters, manage their emotions or solve problems with peers. A variety of scientific evidence has also found that the pandemic seems to have affected some young children\u2019s early development. Boys were more affected than girls, studies have found. \u201cI definitely think children born then have had developmental challenges compared to prior years,\u201d said Dr. Jaime Peterson, a pediatrician at Oregon Health and Science University, whose research is on kindergarten readiness. \u201cWe asked them to wear masks, not see adults, not play with kids. We really severed those interactions, and you don\u2019t get that time back for kids.\u201d The pandemic\u2019s effect on older children \u2014 who were sent home during school closures, and lost significant ground in math and reading \u2014 has been well documented. But the impact on the youngest children is in some ways surprising: They were not in formal school when the pandemic began, and at an age when children spend a lot of time at home anyway. The early years, though, are most critical for brain development. Researchers said several aspects of the pandemic affected young children \u2014 parental stress, less exposure to people, lower preschool attendance, more time on screens and less time playing. Yet because their brains are developing so rapidly, they are also well positioned to catch up, experts said. The youngest children represent \u201ca pandemic tsunami\u201d headed for the American education system, said Joel Ryan, who works with a network of Head Start and state preschool centers in Washington State, where he has seen an increase in speech delays and behavioral problems. Not every young child is showing delays. Children at schools that are mostly Black or Hispanic or where most families have lower incomes are the most behind, according to data released Monday by Curriculum Associates, whose tests are given in thousands of U.S. schools. Students from higher-income families are more on pace with historical trends. But \u201cmost, if not all, young students were impacted academically to some degree,\u201d said Kristen Huff, vice president for assessment and research at Curriculum Associates. Recovery is possible, experts said, though young children have not been a main focus of $122 billion in federal aid distributed to school districts to help students recover. \u201cWe 100 percent have the tools to help kids and families recover,\u201d said Catherine Monk, a clinical psychologist and professor at Columbia, and a chair of a research project on mothers and babies in the pandemic. \u201cBut do we know how to distribute, in a fair way, access to the services they need?\u201d \u201cI spent a long time just teaching kids to sit still on the carpet for one book. That\u2019s something I didn\u2019t need to do before.\u201d \u201cWe are talking 4- and 5-year-olds who are throwing chairs, biting, hitting, without the self-regulation.\u201d Brook Allen, in Martin, Tenn., has taught kindergarten for 11 years. This year, for the first time, she said, several students could barely speak, several were not toilet trained, and several did not have the fine motor skills to hold a pencil. Children don\u2019t engage in imaginative play or seek out other children the way they used to, said Michaela Frederick, a pre-K teacher for students with learning delays in Sharon, Tenn. She\u2019s had to replace small building materials in her classroom with big soft blocks because students\u2019 fine motor skills weren\u2019t developed enough to manipulate them. Michaela Frederick, a pre-K teacher in Sharon, Tenn., playing a stacking game with a student. Aaron Hardin for The New York Times Preschoolers do not have the same fine motor skills as they did prepandemic, Ms. Frederick said. Aaron Hardin for The New York Times Perhaps the biggest difference Lissa O\u2019Rourke has noticed among her preschoolers in St. Augustine, Fla., has been their inability to regulate their emotions: \u201cIt was knocking over chairs, it was throwing things, it was hitting their peers, hitting their teachers.\u201d Data from schools underscores what early childhood professionals have noticed. Children who just finished second grade, who were as young as 3 or 4 when the pandemic began, remain behind children the same age prepandemic, particularly in math, according to the new Curriculum Associates data. Of particular concern, the students who are the furthest behind are making the least progress catching up. The youngest students\u2019 performance is \u201cin stark contrast\u201d to older elementary school children, who have caught up much more, the researchers said. The new analysis examined testing data from about four million children, with cohorts before and after the pandemic. Data from Cincinnati Public Schools is another example: Just 28 percent of kindergarten students began this school year prepared, down from 36 percent before the pandemic, according to research from Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the muscle strength because everything they are doing at home is screen time. They are just swiping.\u201d \u201cI have more kids in kindergarten who have never been in school.\u201d One explanation for young children\u2019s struggles, childhood development experts say, is parental stress during the pandemic. A baby who is exposed to more stress will show more activation on brain imaging scans in \u201cthe parts of that baby\u2019s brain that focus on fear and focus on aggression,\u201d said Rahil D. Briggs, a child psychologist with Zero to Three, a nonprofit that focuses on early childhood. That leaves less energy for parts of the brain focused on language, exploration and learning, she said. During lockdowns, children also spent less time overhearing adult interactions that exposed them to new language, like at the grocery store or the library. And they spent less time playing with other children. Kelsey Schnur, 32, of Sharpsville, Pa., pulled her daughter, Finley, from child care during the pandemic. Finley, then a toddler, colored, did puzzles and read books at home. But when she finally enrolled in preschool, she struggled to adjust, her mother said. She was diagnosed with separation anxiety and selective mutism. \u201cIt was very eye-opening to see,\u201d said Ms. Schnur, who works in early childhood education. \u201cThey can have all of the education experiences and knowledge, but that socialization is so key.\u201d Preschool attendance can significantly boost kindergarten preparedness, research has found. But in many states, preschool attendance is still below prepandemic levels. Survey data suggests low-income families have not returned at the same rate as higher-income families. \u201cI have never had such a small class,\u201d said Analilia Sanchez, who had nine children in her preschool class in El Paso this year. She typically has at least 16. \u201cI think they got used to having them at home \u2014 that fear of being around the other kids, the germs.\u201d Time on screens also spiked during the pandemic \u2014 as parents juggled work and children cooped up at home \u2014 and screen time stayed up after lockdowns ended. Many teachers and early childhood experts believe this affected children\u2019s attention spans and fine motor skills. Long periods of screen time have been associated with developmental delays. Heidi Tringali, an occupational therapist in Charlotte, N.C., playing with a patient. Travis Dove for The New York Times Children are showing effects of spending time on screens, Ms. Tringali said, including shorter attention spans, less core strength and delayed social skills. Travis Dove for The New York Times Heidi Tringali, a pediatric occupational therapist in Charlotte, N.C., said she and her colleagues are seeing many more families contact them with children who don\u2019t fit into typical diagnoses. She is seeing \u201cvisual problems, core strength, social skills, attention \u2014 all the deficits,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really see the difference in them not being out playing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m actually happy with the majority of their growth.\u201d \u201cThey just crave consistency that they didn\u2019t get.\u201d It\u2019s too early to know whether young children will experience long-term effects from the pandemic, but researchers say there are reasons to be optimistic. \u201cIt is absolutely possible to catch up, if we catch things early,\u201d said Dr. Dani Dumitriu, a pediatrician and neuroscientist at Columbia and chair of the study on pandemic newborns. \u201cThere is nothing deterministic about a brain at six months.\u201d There may also have been benefits to being young in the pandemic, she and others said, like increased resiliency and more time with family. Some places have invested in programs to support young children, like a Tennessee district that is doubling the number of teaching assistants in kindergarten classrooms next school year and adding a preschool class for students needing extra support. Oregon used some federal pandemic aid money to start a program to help prepare children and parents for kindergarten the summer before. For many students, simply being in school is the first step. Sarrah Hovis, a preschool teacher in Roseville, Mich., has seen plenty of the pandemic\u2019s impact in her classroom. Some children can\u2019t open a bag of chips, because they lack finger strength. More of her students are missing many days of school, a national problem since the pandemic. But she has also seen great progress. By the end of this year, some of her students were counting to 100, and even adding and subtracting. \u201cIf the kids come to school,\u201d she said, \u201cthey do learn.\u201d The pandemic changed families\u2019 lives and the culture of education: \u201cOur relationship with school became optional.\u201d Produced by Alice Fang  Enjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.

  "2025-04-26_189706_1": "Supported by Prosecutors said the Montanan illegally used tissue from a sheep from Central Asia and the testicles from a bighorn sheep to make large hybrids that he could sell at premium prices. An 81-year-old Montana rancher was sentenced to six months in federal prison on Monday for running a nearly decade-long scheme in which he used parts from protected wildlife to create a giant hybrid species of wild sheep to sell at premium prices, federal prosecutors said. The man, Arthur Schubarth, of Vaughn, Mont., illegally used tissue from a Marco Polo argali sheep from Central Asia and the testicles of a bighorn sheep native to the Rocky Mountains to make large hybrids of sheep that he could sell at high prices to shooting preserves, particularly in Texas, federal prosecutors said in a news release. Mr. Schubarth pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Montana in March to two felony wildlife crimes: conspiracy to violate the Lacey Act and substantively violating the Lacey Act, which prohibits the trafficking of illegally taken wildlife. The Associated Press reported that Judge Brian Morris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana said that he had weighed Mr. Schubarth\u2019s age and lack of criminal record to fashion a sentence that would discourage others from attempting to \u201cchange the genetic makeup of the creatures.\u201d Mr. Schubarth\u2019s sentence includes three years of supervised release, according to court documents. He was also ordered to pay a $20,000 fine to the Lacey Act Reward Fund, a $4,000 payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and a $200 special assessment. Before sentencing, Mr. Schubarth told the judge, \u201cI will have to work the rest of my life to repair everything I\u2019ve done,\u201d The A.P. reported.

The sense of grievance erupted as powerfully as the verdict itself. From the low hills of northwest Georgia to a veterans\u2019 retreat in Alaska to suburban New Hampshire, the corners of conservative America resounded with anger over the New York jury\u2019s declaration that former President Donald J. Trump was guilty. But their discontent was about more than the 34 felony counts that Mr. Trump was convicted on, which his supporters quickly dismissed as politically motivated. They saw in the jury\u2019s finding a rejection of themselves, and the values they believed their nation should uphold. Broad swaths of liberal America may have found long-awaited justice in the trial\u2019s outcome. But for many staunch Trump loyalists \u2014 people who for years have listened to and believed Mr. Trump\u2019s baseless claims that the system is rigged against him, and them \u2014 the verdict on Thursday threatened to shatter their faith in democracy itself. \u201cWe are at that crossroads.

  "2025-04-26_572534_1": "Germany\u2019s Politics Supported by The prospect of a strong performance by the far-right Alternative for Germany party in two state elections is only one of the problems for Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Reporting from Berlin On Sunday, voters in the eastern German states of Saxony and Thuringia go to the polls in elections that are being carefully watched in Berlin and across Europe, in part because the far-right Alternative for Germany party is poised to do well in one or both elections. The two states, which were under Communist rule until 1990, will be voting for their state house representatives and ultimately their state government. While those eligible to cast ballots in the two state elections represent only about 7 percent of Germany\u2019s total electorate, the vote still promises to be important \u2014 for both the potential success of an anti-immigrant, nationalist party and because of the rise of a left-wing party built around a former Communist, known as the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, after its leader. That party, founded only this year, is likely to outpace most mainstream parties, and it is predicted to come in third in both state house races. The results are expected to be a clear sign of the East\u2019s discontent with the federal government in Berlin. Some or all of the parties that make up Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party governing coalition could be kicked out of the state houses in Saxony and Thuringia for failing to reach the required 5 percent threshold in Sunday\u2019s elections. The likely results will bring a dilemma for mainstream parties: either do everything possible to prevent the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, from forming a state government \u2014 further aggrieving voters who say their voices are not heard \u2014 or go against party orthodoxy and work with the far right in the hopes of reining it in. Even if the elections themselves are for two state governments \u2014 and Saxony and Thuringia are the seventh and 12th largest by population of Germany\u2019s 16 states \u2014 the symbolic importance of a far-right party potentially winning a plurality of votes in Germany, nearly eight decades after the end of the Nazi era, cannot be overstated.

  "2025-04-26_467239_1": "China\u2019s Economy Supported by China\u2019s leaders vowed to kick-start spending by offering subsidies for households to buy cars and appliances. But many consumers aren\u2019t biting. Reporting from Nanchang and Jingdezhen, China Four months ago, China\u2019s leaders announced what seemed like a straightforward and proven plan to recharge the economy: Subsidize consumers who want to replace old cars and household appliances. The early results are not promising. Only 113,000 cars qualified for trade-in subsidies through June 25 \u2014 a blip in a country where monthly sales exceed two million cars. And buyers of new appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators are being offered discounts of only about 10 percent, depending on what city they live in. The incentives are not enough to bring customers into stores. \u201cIf it is not needed, people will not go out of their way to find an old machine to participate,\u201d said Dai Yu, the manager of an appliance store in Jingdezhen, a city in Jiangxi Province in south-central China. The idea of providing financial incentives to spur consumer spending is not new. In 2009, the United States, Germany, France, Spain and Austria offered so-called cash for clunkers programs to revive car sales. They paid households to scrap gas guzzlers and replace them with newer cars with better fuel economy. China itself gave extensive tax cuts and subsidies for consumers to buy new cars and household appliances. Prices for many appliances were cut in half, particularly for rural residents, and sales surged. The current strategy has been held back by tight eligibility restrictions and limited financing. As often happens, China\u2019s central government has turned the appliance program almost entirely over to provincial and local governments, many of which are struggling with heavy debts and reluctant to offer more generous subsidies. The central government, which has fewer debts, pays 60 percent of the cost of the car subsidies. So the effort has not yet fixed one of China\u2019s biggest economic problems right now: weak spending by consumers. Factories have responded by chasing more customers overseas, but that has incited a backlash and trade restrictions by governments in Europe, the United States and developing countries.

  "2025-04-26_95997_1": "Supported by wordplay, the crossword column Rajeswari Rajamani makes her New York Times Crossword debut. Jump to: Today\u2019s Theme | Tricky Clues THURSDAY PUZZLE \u2014 I\u2019m always happy to welcome new constructors into the fold. I\u2019m even more happy when they make their debuts on a Thursday \u2014 that beautiful, infuriating day of the week when any sort of wordplay or trickery can happen in the puzzles \u2014 because I get to witness a new voice emerging. So do you. This is Rajeswari Rajamani\u2019s debut in The New York Times, and if this is any indication of her talent, I hope to see more from her. The theme set in her puzzle is particularly tight, and her clues make her mid-to-late-week puzzle very accessible. There\u2019s even a neat trick that I will explain in the theme section. That\u2019s enough to keep me happy on a Thursday. Ms. Rajamani finished the Diverse Crossword Constructors Fellowship under the tutelage of Sam Ezersky, one of our puzzle editors, and I think that he guided her well. \u201cRaji was such a pleasure to work with!\u201d Mr. Ezersky said. \u201cAn innate talent alongside an eagerness to learn really set her apart, and both of these attributes are nicely reflected in today\u2019s puzzle.\u201d I\u2019d like to drop a pearl of experience (I wouldn\u2019t call it wisdom, necessarily) that not everyone thinks about while solving: Sometimes, in order to solve a puzzle, you will have to go back and alter the clues themselves. If a puzzle\u2019s answers don\u2019t make sense relative to its clues, take another peek at the clues to see if the constructor left any further instructions. Very often, you will find this information in the revealer. In Ms. Rajamani\u2019s puzzle, the revealer clue is at 61A, which reads [Many a gymgoer\u2019s goal \u2026 or what the starred clues in this puzzle must have for their answers to make sense?] and the answer is RIPPED ABS. That tells us two things: We need to do something to the theme clues in order for the answers to make sense, and that something is ripping the letters A and B (or AB) out of those clues to make ones that agree with their answers. I thought that this was a particularly nice find on Ms. Rajamani\u2019s part, especially as a debut constructor: She noticed that some words in her clues could be altered to make other words, and she was able to develop a tight set of these examples. \u201cAs for the theme, the idea of reinterpreting RIPPED ABS is thoughtful and playful,\u201d Mr. Ezersky said, \u201cand the clue-driven twists are quite surprising: Something like [Like some nasty habits] reads so naturally!\u201d Let\u2019s look at 17A. The clue is [They\u2019re found next to cabarets], and the answer, supposedly, is EXPONENTS. You were probably scratching your head at this point, but what if you ripped AB from the word \u201ccabaret\u201d? That would change the clue to [They\u2019re found next to carets], which makes more sense. Carets are the upward-pointing arrows that are used to indicate mathematical EXPONENTS. Similarly, at 49A, the clue is [Like some nasty habits], and the answer is BELOW THE BELT. While we might all agree that hitting BELOW THE BELT is a nasty habit, if we remove AB from the clue, we wind up with [Like some nasty hits]. That\u2019s much better \u2014 but always gird your loins just in case. 14A. One way to [Signal a stop, say] when trying to catch a taxi is to put your hand out and HAIL it. 19A. Were you tricked by this clue? At first, I wanted \u201ccases\u201d to be the answer to [Airpods come in them], but I knew that was wrong because I already had the second I in 11D\u2019s IDIOM. It turns out that AirPods come in PAIRS. 42A. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve heard the word RIDGY used as an adjective, but it certainly describes [corduroy fabric]. 64A. This one made me laugh. The combination of symbols is a written indicator of cursing, and the fact that it\u2019s in brackets means that it\u2019s either unsaid or a mechanical response to the naughty words. The answer is BLEEP. 11D. I mentioned the answer before, but this [Bad apple or sour grapes, e.g.] is not a fruit salad that has spoiled. They are both IDIOMs. 13D. This clue is another example of why you should keep asking yourself, \u201cWhat else could this mean?\u201d The weavers in [Things weavers weave] are not humans; they\u2019re birds, and they weave NESTS. 33D. I\u2019m beginning to think that my solving ability is slightly off because I solved this at the beginning of the week when I still had Monday brain. The [Endpoint of a radius] is not a math clue, Deb, it\u2019s an anatomy clue. This radius is the bone that runs from the wrist to the ELBOW. 43D. [Where you find yourself on edge?] is an ICE RINK, and whether that means that you are on the edge of the blades on your skates or you are clinging for dear life to the edge of the rink is entirely up to you. I grew up in India and moved to the United States 11 years ago. I live in New Jersey with my husband and teen daughter. I am a software professional who likes to try her hand at new hobbies every once in a while. I have always loved puzzles and word games, and I enjoy creating riddle- or crossword-themed gift hunts for my daughter\u2019s birthdays. I began solving Times crosswords during the Covid pandemic and quickly realized that cheating my way through the late-week puzzles had taught me more about American life, pop culture and sports than a decade of living here had. The first New York Times Diverse Crossword Constructors fellowship announcement encouraged me to check out Times-style crossword construction, and I have been addicted to it ever since! I\u2019m thrilled to finally make my Times debut. My original puzzle had clues sporting \u201cripped\u201d ABs instead of having those ABs waiting to be ripped. Thanks to my mentor Sam Ezersky, I can now see how the latter is so much more intuitive and fun for the solver. Sam and the editorial team have been a great inspiration, showing me what it takes to transform a workable grid into a Times-worthy one. I hope you enjoy solving the puzzle as much as I enjoyed creating it! Want to be part of the conversation about New York Times Games, or maybe get some help with a particularly thorny puzzle?

  "2025-04-26_32087_1": "OpinionMichelle Goldberg Credit...Mark Peterson for The New York Times Supported by Opinion Columnist Last Tuesday evening in Midtown Manhattan, Jackson Reffitt, a 22-year-old from Texas, cried through the first professional play he\u2019d ever seen, which was about him. \u201cFatherland,\u201d which recently opened Off Broadway, tells the story of how Jackson came to turn in his father, Guy Reffitt, a member of the antigovernment Three Percenter militia, for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. It depicts Guy growing increasingly radicalized and agitated, stocking up on weapons and boasting to Jackson, a Bernie Sanders supporter, that something big was in the offing. He eventually carried a gun to the Capitol, where he threatened to drag Nancy Pelosi out of the building by her ankles. A few days later, he told Jackson and his sister, \u201cIf you turn me in, you\u2019re a traitor, and traitors get shot.\u201d What he didn\u2019t realize is that Jackson, panicked by his father\u2019s violent outbursts, had sent a tip to the F.B.I. on Christmas Eve of 2020. After the Capitol attack, he met with an agent and later testified at the trial in which Guy was convicted and then sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Jackson had nothing to do with the creation of the play, a piece of documentary theater in which every line was taken from official sources like court records and recordings. \u201cFatherland\u201d uses his words and his story but not his name \u2014 the characters are referred to simply as Father and Son. Jackson learned of it from a text from his sister when it opened in Los Angeles this year. But he\u2019d since been in touch with its creator, Stephen Sachs, and decided he had to see it for himself, traveling to New York and staying with friends in Brooklyn. The experience of sitting in the dark and watching the worst moments of his life recreated onstage was at once wrenching and therapeutic. He hadn\u2019t expected it all to feel so real. One reason I was eager to speak to Jackson, an earnest, polite community-college student wearing a T-shirt celebrating labor organizing, is that his story, while extreme, is also archetypical of the Trump years, which have been marked by countless tales of family estrangement. Some of these ruptures involve famous people, like George and Kellyanne Conway, Elon Musk and his daughter Vivian, and Rudy Giuliani and his daughter, Caroline. Many more are anonymous. A 2017 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 13 percent of respondents had ended a relationship with a family member or close friend because of the presidential election.

  "2025-04-26_789153_1": "Supported by It was a big day for the far-right National Rally. Just how big will not be clear until after a second round of voting. Reporting from Paris A new week of frenetic campaigning started in France on Monday, a day after the far-right National Rally party dominated the first round of legislative elections that attracted an unusually high number of voters and dealt a stinging blow to President Emmanuel Macron. Voters are being asked to choose their representatives in the 577-seat National Assembly, the country\u2019s lower and more prominent house of Parliament. They will return to the polls on Sunday for the second round of voting. If a new majority of lawmakers opposed to Mr. Macron is ushered in, he will be forced to appoint a political adversary as prime minister, substantially shifting France\u2019s domestic policy and muddling its foreign policy. That will be especially so if he is forced to govern alongside Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old president of the National Rally who the party wants to become prime minister. If no clear majority emerges, the country could be headed for months of political deadlock or turmoil. Mr. Macron, who has ruled out resigning, cannot call new legislative elections for another year. Official results published by the Interior Ministry showed that the anti-immigrant National Rally party and its allies won about 33 percent of the vote. The New Popular Front, a broad alliance of left-wing parties, got about 28 percent; Mr. Macron\u2019s centrist Renaissance party and its allies garnered about 20 percent; and mainstream conservatives got only about 6.7 percent. Here are five takeaways from the first round to help make sense of the elections so far. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_791630_1": "Global Economy The leading U.S. electric-vehicle maker also drew buyers eager to take advantage of government incentives that will be harder to get in 2024. Tesla sales jumped during the last three months of 2023 after the carmaker slashed prices and customers rushed to take advantage of tax breaks on electric vehicles \u2014 provisions that will be harder to come by in 2024. The company said on Tuesday that it sold 484,500 cars in the fourth quarter, up from 435,000 in the third quarter and 405,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, Tesla sold 1.8 million vehicles. The gains put Tesla on track to sell more than two million cars in 2024, potentially overtaking established carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and Renault. The rebound in sales during the fourth quarter should help calm investor concerns about whether Tesla can defend its dominance of the market for electric vehicles as it faces increased competition from traditional carmakers. During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles. Tesla accounts for half the electric cars sold in the United States. In 2022, Tesla accounted for two-thirds of the market. Another electric vehicle maker, Rivian, said on Tuesday that it sold nearly 14,000 vehicles in the last three months of the year. That number was up substantially from a year earlier but down about 10 percent from the third quarter. In China, the largest market for electric cars, Tesla faces intense competition from BYD and other Chinese automakers. BYD sold 526,000 fully electric cars worldwide in the fourth quarter, exceeding Tesla, a milestone that many auto analysts had been expecting given the Chinese company\u2019s rapid growth.

  "2025-04-26_350071_1": "Supported by Jordan Goudreau, 48, had taken credit for a failed coup attempt against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela. He faces federal charges of illegal arms smuggling. A former U.S. Green Beret who orchestrated a disastrous failed coup attempt against the authoritarian president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela in 2020 was arrested Tuesday in New York on federal arms smuggling charges. The federal authorities accused Jordan G. Goudreau, 48, and a co-conspirator, Yacsy Alexandra Alvarez, of exporting military-style rifles, night vision devices, lasers, silencers and other military equipment without a license to Colombia beginning in November 2019 for use in carrying out \u201cactivities in Venezuela,\u201d the Justice Department said in a news release on Wednesday. The charges appear to refer to the botched cross-border raid carried out in May 2020 by dozens of armed, self-declared freedom fighters, including former Venezuelan soldiers and former American Special Forces operators, who aimed to topple Mr. Maduro. Mr. Goudreau, of Melbourne, Fla., who did not participate in the raid, publicly took credit for the failed incursion known as Operation Gideon, which he said he had planned with disaffected Venezuelan officials. The audacious rebellion left observers around the world wondering why a decorated former U.S. Special Forces soldier who had served several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan was leading a foreign insurrection. A group of only about 60 men had planned to land on Venezuelan soil near the capital, Caracas, from speedboats and ultimately capture Mr. Maduro. But they were repelled by the Venezuelan security forces. Six men were killed and 13 others were detained, including two former Green Berets who were said to have been recruited by Mr. Goudreau, according to The Associated Press. The Americans were sentenced to 20 years in prison by the Venezuelan authorities in August 2020 but were released in a prisoner exchange deal with the United States late last year. Mr. Goudreau and Ms. Alvarez, a Venezuelan national who lives in Tampa, Fla., face charges of conspiracy to violate export laws, smuggling goods from the United States and violating federal firearm export control acts, prosecutors said. Mr. Goudreau faces additional charges of violating the National Firearms Act and unlawful possession of machine guns, prosecutors said. The pair faces maximum prison sentences of five years for conspiracy, 10 years for smuggling, 20 years for export control law violations and 10 years for each violation of the National Firearms Act and unlawful possession of a machine gun, prosecutors said. A lawyer for Mr. Goudreau could not be immediately reached Wednesday. Christopher A. Kerr, a lawyer for Ms. Alvarez, told The Associated Press that his client planned to plead not guilty. The charges were announced just days after Venezuela\u2019s electoral body declared Mr. Maduro the winner of another six-year term as president in a vote that was marred by widespread irregularities and rejected by the country\u2019s opposition and other nations, including the United States. Four years ago, Mr. Goudreau bragged about his involvement in the thwarted attempt to remove Mr. Maduro, a strong man known for overseeing Venezuela\u2019s plunge into a chronic economic crisis and for using violence to squash dissent and keep a stranglehold on the office he has held since 2013. Mr. Maduro claimed at the time that the operation was a failed coup attempt backed by the United States. The administration of President Donald J. Trump denied being \u201cdirectly involved.\u201d Mr. Goudreau, the owner of a Florida-based security company called Silvercorp, claimed that the operation was the result of a multimillion-dollar agreement he had struck with the Venezuelan opposition, led by the U.S.-backed Juan Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself the legitimate leader of Venezuela. An adviser to Mr. Guaid\u00f3 told The New York Times that such an agreement had been briefly reached in October 2019 but was terminated within days by the opposition, and he said Mr. Goudreau had proceeded with the coup on his own. Court documents detailed a long list of equipment and firearm orders made by Mr. Goudreau in 2019 and early 2020, message exchanges with associates and several trips he and Ms. Alvarez had made to Colombia. According to federal prosecutors, in a text message to an associate in December 2019, Mr. Goudreau wrote, \u201cWe def need our guns,\u201d when discussing what items to take on one trip. Mr. Goudreau and Ms. Alvarez exported the firearms and other equipment to Colombia through Mr. Goudreau\u2019s security firm, prosecutors said. Some of the items were seized by the Colombian authorities, they said. A federal prison database showed that Mr. Goudreau was being held at a Brooklyn detention center.

  "2025-04-26_398593_1": "Supported by Wordplay, The CROSSWORD COLUMN Eric Warren\u2019s Saturday debut fits a lot of fun into tight spaces. SATURDAY PUZZLE \u2014 This is Eric Warren\u2019s second puzzle for The New York Times after his Friday debut in March 2023, and I think the two grids are at about the same level of difficulty. They have a similarly low word count, which is challenging for both the creator and the solver. Today we have only 66 clues, most of which lead to longer entries presented in stacks and stairs. This configuration looks imposing, but there are mild entries that made it solve quite smoothly for me. A couple of examples are in modern slang, but they\u2019re \u201creal ones\u201d \u2014 not \u201ccringe.\u201d There are also some odd spellings that might gray a hair or two by the end of your solve, as you hunt for that last wrong square. The wordplay throughout is sublime, and a lot of the entries are so interesting that you\u2019ll think about them well afterward. 8A. This \u201cArrangement following a union agreement, perhaps,\u201d is BACK PAY, which is compensation for time working for lower wages, rather than backbreaking labor (though both situations could apply). If you\u2019re curious about your case, you can look up employers on the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s website. 16A. Odd spelling alert: The \u201cTitle woman in a 1968 Turtles hit\u201d here is ELENORE, not \u201cEleanor\u201d or \u201cElinore\u201d or \u201cElanore.\u201d I eventually figured it out, but it would be nice if the Turtles spelled it out. 22A. Sometimes I fall into a rabbit hole of galactic dimensions when I look up something for this column, like the answer for \u201cFlighty sorts, in two senses.\u201d This is a great clue for SPACE CADETS. The term originated in 1940s science fiction, when it referred to skilled people exploring outer space, and had that definition through the 1950s, when the Space Age was starting. People went space crazy then, and there was a moment on a 1955 episode of \u201cThe Honeymooners\u201d where Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton buy a television and argue over what to watch. Ed keeps switching to a show about space rangers, and, in exasperation, Ralph calls him a \u201cspace cadet.\u201d It\u2019s a funny line, and it comes from one of America\u2019s seminal insult lobbers, but its meaning here was still that of an aficionado of all things space. The term\u2019s second meaning, someone out of touch with reality, came along in the 1960s or \u201970s, probably out of drug culture. 37A. \u201cPitchers on a farm\u201d had me thinking of milk jugs and then ears, as in \u201clittle pitchers have big ears.\u201d The \u201cpitchers\u201d in that proverb are two-handled vessels; as a city kid, I first saw this expression in \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\u201d my earliest encounter with farming and agrarian life. Anyway, the answer is HAY FORKS, which are used to throw (\u201cpitch\u201d) enormous piles of dried stems into carts. 54A. This is somewhat tricky history. The \u201cExcavation site since the Bronze Age\u201d isn\u2019t one specific location, it\u2019s a TIN MINE, since bronze is most often an alloy of the elements copper and tin. (We went from the Space Age to the Bronze Age in 10 rows of puzzle today. It\u2019s amazing how fast that can happen.) 12D. This is a deducible factoid, with a few letters from crossing entries: The \u201cAnimal on Greenland\u2019s coat of arms\u201d is a POLAR BEAR, walking on its hind legs and possibly hurling invective at someone offstage. 28D. \u201cWhen one might be on track to arrive?\u201d is a posterchild of a dad joke. One arrives on a track after a TRAIN TRIP. The New York Times Crossword has an open submission system, and you can submit your puzzles online.

Senator JD Vance of Ohio took a break from debate preparation on Monday evening to make a direct pitch to the Republican Party\u2019s billionaire class. Appearing in a private dining room at the French restaurant Le Bernardin in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Vance addressed some of the party\u2019s biggest donors at a private sit-down before the American Opportunity Alliance, according to five people briefed on his remarks. Mr. Vance was interviewed by Reihan Salam, the head of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the event was private. The American Opportunity Alliance, a Wall Street-heavy crowd, includes some major Republican donors who are not yet backing former President Donald J. Trump and his running mate, Mr. Vance. Others, like Paul Singer, a leader of the group, are on board. Mr. Vance received some credit from some members for having shown up before a group that disagrees with some of his positions on the economy and foreign policy. He spoke a bit about the vice-presidential debate, which is what brought him to New York this week. He was asked how he would be able to keep a straight face when engaging with Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, his Democratic opponent on Tuesday night, the people said. Mr. Vance pointed out Mr. Walz\u2019s penchant for gesticulating, and said he would try to keep the focus on issues like the border, which Mr. Vance sees as a major liability for the Harris-Walz ticket, the people said. Mr. Vance at one point joked that if he did well on Tuesday evening, it would be thanks to his wife, Usha, who joined the meeting. If he did poorly, he said the fault would be his alone, recalled one of the people. Mr. Vance was asked how the ticket could build a broad coalition and appeal to more moderate Republicans, such as backers of Nikki Haley and Mitt Romney, two people said. Mr. Vance expressed a desire to win them back and asked for help. At multiple points, Mr. Vance acknowledged that some of his positions were probably not popular in the room, the people said.

Lisa Lerer reported from New York and Maya King reported from the National Association of Black Journalists\u2019 conference in Chicago. The audience of Black journalists was prepared for a combative exchange well before Donald J. Trump took the stage on Wednesday for an interview at their annual gathering in Chicago. Yet when Mr. Trump, just minutes in, began questioning Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s racial identity, there was an instant ripple of reaction \u2014 a low rumble that grew into a roar of disapproval. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don\u2019t know, is she Indian or is she Black?\u201d Mr. Trump said of Ms. Harris, whose mother was Indian American and whose father is Black. The moment was shocking, but for those who have followed Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive language, it was hardly surprising. The former president has a history of using race to pit groups of Americans against one another, amplifying a strain of racial politics that has risen as a generation of Black politicians has ascended. The audacity of Mr. Trump, a white man, questioning how much a Black woman truly belongs to Black America was particularly incendiary. And it evoked an ugly history in this country, in which white America has often declared the racial categories that define citizens, and sought to determine who gets to call themselves what.

The film features surveillance video of the man from Georgia, Mark Andrews, as he places ballots into a drop box near Atlanta, along with voice-over commentary by Mr. D\u2019Souza calling the action \u201ca crime\u201d and adding, \u201cThese are fraudulent votes.\u201d Although Mr. Andrews\u2019s face is blurred in the images, the film\u2019s producers used unblurred versions of the same video to promote the film on a variety of conservative news outlets, including Tucker Carlson\u2019s former show on Fox News and a show hosted by Charlie Kirk, a founder of Turning Point USA, and produced by Salem. Mr. Andrews sued Mr. D\u2019Souza, along with Salem and two individuals associated with the right-wing election-monitoring group True the Vote, for defamation in October 2022. State investigators in Georgia have since found that Mr. Andrews committed no crime and that he had legally deposited the ballots for himself and several members of his family.

  "2025-04-26_116217_1": "Middle East Tensions Supported by One of the victims, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was a dual Israeli American citizen. The Israeli military said on Sunday that six bodies found in Gaza were hostages who had been \u201cbrutally murdered\u201d by Hamas, setting off a wave of nationwide grief mixed with anger. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military\u2019s chief spokesman, said the bodies had been recovered a day earlier from a tunnel underneath the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza, close to where a seventh hostage, Farhan al-Qadi, was found alive last week. \u201cThey were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists a short time before we reached them,\u201d Admiral Hagari said. Israel\u2019s health ministry said later on Sunday that a forensic examination showed the hostages had been shot at close range sometime between Thursday and Friday morning.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was \u201cshocked to the depths\u201d of his soul by what he called the \u201ccoldblooded murder\u201d of the hostages. \u201cThe heart of the entire nation is torn,\u201d he said in a statement. In an initial statement, Hamas did not directly address the accusations, but said responsibility for the deaths lay with Israel, which it blamed for the lack of an agreement to stop the fighting in Gaza. Hamas later claimed in a separate statement, without providing evidence, that the hostages were killed by the Israeli military\u2019s bullets.

  "2025-04-26_824254_1": "California Today The state has one of the country\u2019s highest hourly minimum wages. Wages just went up for thousands of Californians. As of yesterday, the state\u2019s overall minimum wage is now $16 an hour, up from $15.50. That is the second-highest statewide minimum in the nation, trailing only Washington at $16.28 (the District of Columbia\u2019s is higher still, at $17 an hour). The latest increase in California is an inflation adjustment, and it builds off a 2016 state law that incrementally raised the minimum wage to $15 from $10. The 50-cent bump affects approximately one million workers, or about 6 percent of the state\u2019s work force, according to Michael Reich, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The impact is relatively limited, he told me, because falling unemployment over the past year has already led to significant wage growth in low-paying jobs, reducing the number of people making the statewide minimum wage. Another factor: Roughly a third of California\u2019s workers live in cities and counties with wage ordinances that set higher minimums than the state\u2019s, including Los Angeles ($16.78 an hour), San Jose ($17.55) and Oakland ($16.50). Indeed, 40 California cities and counties require employers to pay wages above the $16 an hour required by the state. Twenty-eight of those municipalities raised their minimums on Jan. 1. West Hollywood currently has the nation\u2019s highest minimum wage, at $19.08 an hour. (My colleague Kurtis Lee recently wrote about how this has caused some angst for local businesses.) Mountain View, Emeryville, Sunnyvale, Berkeley and San Francisco all require between $18 and $19 an hour, rounding out the top six in California.

  "2025-04-26_798698_1": "Supported by The multibillion-dollar deal will reverse a decision the plane maker made two decades ago to outsource production of key parts to independent suppliers. Boeing said on Monday that it had agreed to buy a major supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, ending a nearly two-decade experiment in outsourcing production of major components of its commercial planes, including the body of the 737 Max and parts of the 767, 777 and 787. In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years. While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business. Boeing has taken internal steps to improve quality, too, after a harrowing incident in which a panel blew out of one of its planes on a flight in January. \u201cBy reintegrating Spirit,\u201d Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said in a statement, the company \u201ccan fully align\u201d its production and safety systems with its work force. The deal, which was widely expected, was valued at $4.7 billion in stock or $8.3 billion including Spirit\u2019s debt. It is subject to approval by regulators and Spirit\u2019s shareholders. Boeing will also spin off portions of Spirit to Airbus, its European rival, as part of the transaction. Boeing said it expected its acquisition of Spirit to close by the middle of next year. The purchase represents a strategic reversal for Boeing, which started relying more extensively on independent suppliers in the early 2000s to cut costs and raise profits. Spirit was created during that outsourcing drive in 2005, when Boeing sold a division in Wichita, Kan., and operations in Oklahoma. Besides its work for Boeing, Spirit makes components for aerospace companies including Airbus, Bombardier, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Rolls-Royce. Boeing accounted for 64 percent of Spirit\u2019s net revenue last year, while Airbus accounted for 19 percent. Boeing offered to buy Spirit at $37.25 per share, a 30 percent premium over Spirit\u2019s stock price at the end of February before the two companies announced they were in talks.

  "2025-04-26_616292_1": "Supported by Guest Essay Mr. Delistraty is a journalist and the author of a book on grief. It comes gradually at first, then, like the Hemingway-ism, suddenly. Beach chairs fold up. Kayaks return to garages. Speculative camping trips remain just that. The plans and possibilities of summer cease. The season\u2019s conclusion can spark a sense of loss. That might sound like an overstatement, but as with any experience that ends too soon, there\u2019s a sense that something has been missed out on, that feelings and moments remain just beyond our grasp. Underscored by popular, often misinterpreted concepts like \u201cclosure\u201d and the \u201cfive stages\u201d leading to \u201cacceptance,\u201d the standard American thinking around loss is to get back to the office, back to school, back to normal. Basically: Suck it up and move on. (Toss your summer whites to the back of the closet and forget about them.) What would it look like to rethink this paradigm, starting with the summer? What might it mean to mourn its passing, to grapple with it instead of pushing ever forward? It\u2019s easy to get sighs and eye rolls when noting how, even compared with more traditionally respected losses, like the death of a parent, the passing of a pet might merit deep grief, or that there\u2019s legitimacy in mourning something as abstract as the end of summer. But the truth is that loss is relative. If it\u2019s significant to you, even if it\u2019s about something intangible \u2014 like losing your sense of purpose or a state of mind or even your summer without feeling you\u2019ve made the most of it \u2014 it\u2019s legitimate. It\u2019s not up to others to decide for you. As the season comes to a close, I\u2019ve re-upped my lapsed journaling routine. A few experiences I\u2019ve found myself writing about: a trip to California to see my family and a crack-of-dawn walk along Stinson Beach; my first time watching professional bull riding, with the stranger next to me explaining its rules on a hot Cheyenne evening; a constellation of fireflies briefly following me as I walked home from the subway. I found myself ruminating not only on what I\u2019d done and what I\u2019d missed but also on what I considered most important. Rituals like journaling, reflecting and mourning are fundamental to how we psychologically construct the past because they inform us of our values and what we want for our futures. What we do at present, of course, crafts the future. The Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu calls this \u201cthe process of fabrication.\u201d That\u2019s why the popular framework of pushing loss aside to just get on with life ultimately fails: The only way to create the life you want is to delve into the past. Zoom out enough, and everyone, at any time, is going through something. \u201cThere is / always grief more than enough, / a heart-load for each of us / on the dusty road,\u201d wrote the poet Mary Oliver. A 2019 survey found that over 70 percent of Americans had grieved over \u201ca life event\u201d in the prior three years, including nearly four in 10 who were mourning the death of a friend or family member. Others mourned relationships ended, illnesses diagnosed, pets deceased and jobs lost. And those are just the \u201cbig\u201d ones: Other griefs abound, from mementos misplaced to seasons slipping away. The ubiquity of loss is a reason to treat others with grace and understanding. It\u2019s also a reason to slow down and look backward from time to time. While pushing forward is the sociocultural name of the game for Americans grappling with loss, humans largely underestimate how much value they\u2019ll find in reflection. One Harvard Business School study, for instance, asked college undergraduates to create \u201ctime capsules\u201d within which they wrote about a variety of recent experiences, such as songs they\u2019d been listening to, a photo they\u2019d been looking at and a conversation they\u2019d just had. They predicted how interested and curious they\u2019d be about the time capsule only to find, when asked again three months later, that they were far more intrigued \u2014 and perceived greater meaning in it \u2014 than they\u2019d expected. \u201cPeople systematically underestimate the value of rediscovering the past,\u201d concluded the study\u2019s authors. All sorts of anxieties might be allayed by attending a little more to what\u2019s preceded them. We might start by simply calling a loss a loss. Even Shakespeare knew the liberating feeling of giving \u201csorrow words.\u201d Per Macbeth\u2019s fourth act: \u201cThe grief that does not speak / Whispers the o\u2019erfraught heart and bids it break.\u201d Once you start looking, there are all sorts of unexpected things one can grieve that often aren\u2019t considered legitimate losses. The end of summer might be one of them. With it comes change. The stress of regular life butting its way back in, school and work returning in full force. It\u2019s the same with the \u201cSunday scaries.\u201d The phenomenon is usually characterized as dread or nervousness about the forthcoming workweek. To my thinking, though, the disquiet that comes from jarring shifts and the unknowable future might be eased by appreciating and learning from the weekend or the summer \u2014 or any pleasure once here, now lost. To best greet the new is to become intimate with the old. What a rare, unexpected fortune that the past, like loss, can be neither escaped nor solved.

Typhoon Krathon was barreling toward Taiwan\u2019s populous southwest on Wednesday with powerful winds and heavy rain, forcing the authorities to ground some domestic flights and close schools and offices. Two people in Taiwan were killed by the storm, two more are missing and more than 100 were injured as of 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday, according to Central News Agency, Taiwan\u2019s state-run news wire. One man fell to his death while trimming a tree while the other man was hit by a boulder while driving. Krathon was forecast to make landfall along the southwestern coast of Taiwan early Thursday, according to the Central News Agency. Forecasters said the storm\u2019s maximum sustained wind speeds dropped by about 20 miles per hour throughout the day ending up at 104 miles per hour, equivalent to those of a Category 2 hurricane. The storm, which was over open water on Wednesday, is expected to make landfall near the port city of Kaohsiung on the southwestern coast, Taiwan\u2019s third biggest city, the local government said. The city\u2019s mayor, Chen Chi-mai, warned of flooding and landslide risks, adding that the storm could bring waves of up to 20 feet to the city, home to about 2.7 million people. Krathon was comparable to Typhoon Thelma, the destructive storm that hit southern Taiwan in 1977 and killed 37 people, he said on social media. In July, Typhoon Gaemi, the strongest storm to hit the island in eight years, inundated Kaohsiung and other southern cities with up to nearly four feet of rain. The typhoon killed 11 people.

Few artists had a more unexpected 2023 than Jelly Roll, the face-tattooed former Southern rapper turned country singer who became one of the year\u2019s most promising new crossover pop stars. His album \u201cWhitsitt Chapel,\u201d which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard all-genre chart in June, is a collection of pop-rock anthems with flourishes of country, and it spawned a pair of hits \u2014 the introspective \u201cNeed a Favor,\u201d and the new version of his viral breakout \u201cSave Me,\u201d featuring Lainey Wilson. He is nominated for two 2024 Grammys at next month\u2019s ceremony: best new artist, and best country group/duo performance. At 39, with many mixtapes under his belt, Jelly Roll (born Jason DeFord) isn\u2019t a traditional new artist nominee, but his creative rebirth, and move from underground circles to the mainstream spotlight, makes him eligible by Grammy guidelines. His competition includes budding pop, rap, dance, R&B and country acts: Gracie Abrams, Fred again.., Ice Spice, Coco Jones, Noah Kahan, Victoria Mon\u00e9t, the War and Treaty. But Jelly Roll might have the most fascinating back story of them all. In addition to his radio and streaming success, he has also become something of a pop culture phenomenon. His Hulu documentary, \u201cJelly Roll: Save Me,\u201d underscores the intense emotional connection that tethers him to his fans, who identify with his hardscrabble struggle tales.

When he won new artist of the year at the C.M.A.s in November, his acceptance speech \u2014 part Tony Robbins, part the Rock \u2014 went wildly viral. And he got to make an appearance alongside the returning W.W.E. favorite Randy Orton on \u201cMonday Night Raw.\u201d Jelly Roll recently appeared on the New York Times video show Popcast (Deluxe) to discuss his breakout year, and how he plans to build on it.

The decision by the Israeli Supreme Court to reject legislative control over the judiciary ends for now the languishing effort by the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu to diminish the courts, which had already sparked nine months of protests that only ended when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. The protests had deeply divided Israel, but the subsequent war united it, with even pilots and reservists who had vowed to ignore military exercises immediately showing up to fight before they were called. If the court\u2019s decision on Monday ripped off this wartime poultice, displaying anew the cultural war at the heart of Israeli politics, Mr. Netanyahu and his government responded by appealing again to wartime unity to try to downplay their loss. It was another version of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s argument against just about every critic of his performance and his policies \u2014 that these are all subjects to be discussed \u201cafter the war.\u201d And the ruling of the court, however important, is expected to have little or no impact on the conduct of the war itself. \u201cI don\u2019t think the ruling will change anything,\u201d said Amit Segal, a political columnist for the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth who reported a leak of the ruling and is considered close to Mr. Netanyahu. Even before the war, he said, \u201cNetanyahu did not have enough artillery, so to speak, to overwhelm the opponents.\u201d So it helps him that this ruling has arrived during war, Mr. Segal said, because \u201che can justify a lack of reaction, and after the war he will have more pressing matters,\u201d like his own political survival.

This three-part documentary series uses different songs from the disco era to highlight the impact the musical genre had on its listeners. In the first episode, the focus is on \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d with conversations about how Middle America reacted to the genre\u2019s queer and hedonistic themes. HARD KNOCKS: OFFSEASON 9 p.m. on HBO. Since 2001, this series has shown us behind the scenes moments from over 20 teams in the N.F.L. season. This new version will instead follow a single team \u2014 this year it\u2019s the New York Giants, as the team prepares for its 100th season. HOPE IN THE WATER 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Documentaries like \u201cSeaspiracy\u201d and \u201cA Plastic Ocean\u201d have warned us about the dangers of the fishing industry and the consequences of ignoring climate change. This documentary series is bit more hopeful since it outlines a solution: sustainable aquaculture, a method of fostering and harvesting seafood for people to eat, while protecting fragile ocean ecosystems.

It was a Lego piece \u2014 black, plastic and missing its upper jaw. Ms. Hardstaff, who grew up in Cornwall, had a long history of finding Lego pieces. As a child there, she collected them from the beach, puzzled about why so many children were forgetting their toys.

For artists like Lenore Tawney, the veil between the spirit realm and this one could prove a valuable means of artistic expression.Credit...Yousuf Karsh Mary Gabriel is the author, most recently, of \u201cMadonna: A Rebel Life\u201d When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE OTHER SIDE: A Story of Women in Art and the Spirit World, by Jennifer Higgie Anyone who has created a work of art knows how it feels to travel to another realm, to leave the world behind and enter a place apart. The artist exists there, poised and sometimes barely breathing, in a state of heightened awareness that is as thrilling as it is excruciating. Thrilling because, if the piece works, the artist will have given birth to something that has never before existed. Excruciating because of that pesky word, \u201cif.\u201d That is what drives artists mad \u2014 along with their solitude as they strive to corral what they cannot see and often don\u2019t understand. The artist and teacher Hans Hofmann identified that quest as the search for the artist\u2019s very \u201cnature,\u201d which, he said, is always art\u2019s true subject. \u201cHow can one paint anything else?\u201d While Hofmann\u2019s conclusion might be a given for men, it has not been for many women artists. Ignored, discouraged and at times even forbidden from painting, women throughout history who craved artistic expression were often forced to sublimate their powerful nature into something deemed less dangerous: the spirit world. That is one of the subjects the Australian critic Jennifer Higgie ponders in her intriguing book, \u201cThe Other Side.\u201d The author of \u201cThe Mirror and the Palette,\u201d a nuanced and idiosyncratic take on female self-portraiture, Higgie explores her subjects through a series of miniature biographies. One she includes here is that of Georgiana Houghton. The 19th-century British painter created abstract works so advanced that she was forced to exhibit them herself with the proviso: \u201cTo those who do not understand the subject, it may be needful to explain that in the execution of the Drawings, she has been entirely guided by invisible spirits.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

The vice-presidential debate between Senator JD Vance of Ohio and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota may not have the sizzle of last month\u2019s confrontation between former President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, but as the last scheduled debate on the 2024 calendar it could still alter the race. For both campaigns, the debate is largely a proxy fight for who can better define and defend the visions of the candidates at the top of the ticket \u2014 and point out inconsistencies. Mr. Walz, 60, and Mr. Vance, 40, have already exchanged a war of words from afar, with the governor selected after his effective branding of Mr. Vance and the Republican ticket as \u201cweird.\u201d Both are veterans, and Mr. Vance questioned Mr. Walz\u2019s military service record almost immediately after he was selected, an expected line of attack at the debate hosted by CBS News. The two candidates will be standing and, unlike in the presidential showdown, no microphones will be muted, raising the possibility of lively exchanges of ideas and insults. Here are five things to watch: To start, Mr. Vance and Mr. Walz are proven debaters and quick-witted communicators. One of the things that helped elevate Mr. Walz onto the national ticket was his disarming way of speaking, both in his national cable television appearances and in his private interactions with Ms. Harris. Ever since, the Harris campaign has leaned into his Midwestern dad persona, with the vice president introducing him as \u201cCoach Walz\u201d and talking up his time as a football coach. The debate will be Mr. Walz\u2019s best opportunity to show that side of him beyond scripted moments on the Democratic convention stage and carefully edited campaign videos, like one of him taking viewers under the hood of his 1979 International Harvester Scout.

  "2025-04-26_760564_1": "Supported by For some fans of Borussia Dortmund, an advertising deal with Rheinmetall, a major arms manufacturer, has overshadowed the run-up to the Champions League final on Saturday. Reporting from Berlin Borussia Dortmund, one of Germany\u2019s most successful soccer clubs, is rooted in the industrial Ruhr region and prides itself on retaining its working-class roots, community engagement and anti-establishment mentality. That\u2019s why, in the week before one of the biggest games in the club\u2019s history, some Dortmund fans are angry about a sponsorship deal with Rheinmetall, a major German weapons producer. Everyone from club officials to lawmakers have weighed in on the move, which has provoked a debate about the normalization of the military in German society. Still, many fans would rather just focus on Dortmund\u2019s appearance in the showcase game of the European season, the Champions League final on Saturday against Real Madrid.  Dortmund\u2019s three-year partnership with Rheinmetall, announced on Wednesday, includes advertising and marketing rights in Dortmund\u2019s stadium and club grounds but not \u2014 crucially for some \u2014 a place on the team\u2019s famed black and yellow jerseys. Neither side would confirm the amount of the deal. Generations of Germans, raised on the postwar idea that \u201cnever again\u201d should their nation foment an armed conflict, remain uneasy associating with the defense industry. Unlike in the United States, where professional and college-level sports games often feature soldiers in uniform unfurling American flags and flyovers from fighter jets, at sporting events in Germany outward displays of patriotism and associations with the military are rare. Some fans would like to keep it that way. \u201cBorussia Dortmund is a soccer club that has been a standard-bearer for tolerance and social projects,\u201d said Inge Fahle, a retired teacher from Dortmund and a fan of the club since childhood. \u201cA sponsorship with a weapons manufacturer just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. Hans-Joachim Watzke, Dortmund\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the club was \u201cconsciously opening ourselves up to a dialogue\u201d by becoming partners with a weapons manufacturer. He said the partnership reflected the role that a company like Rheinmetall has come to play in German society, since the country stepped in to support Ukraine after it was invaded by Russia.

Maya Tekeli reported from Copenhagen, and Emma Bubola from London. Like most Britons, many Danes have known only one queen throughout their lifetime \u2014 one who was extremely popular, and known for her sense of responsibility, propriety and commitment to her duties. On Sunday, the Danish queen, Margrethe, said she would step down this month. That paves for the way for her son Prince Frederik, 55, to ascend to the throne. Like King Charles III of Britain, who became king after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Frederik is part of a younger generation of royals who have had their lives relentlessly documented in the media and who have embraced contemporary stances, chiefly the fight against climate change. While Queen Margrethe once upset scientists for saying she was not convinced that climate change was directly caused by humans, her son is known for his preoccupation with environmental issues. Prince Frederik has described how a trip to the Arctic permanently changed his perspective on the climate crisis, persuading him that it was his personal duty to speak out. He has attended United Nations climate summits and has given many speeches and interviews on environmental matters, underlining the urgency to act and pressuring investors to use capital in ways that address global warming. Pernille Almlund, a communications professor at Roskilde University in Denmark, said that, like most businesses, a modern royal family could not refrain from being involved in climate issues. \u201cThey also have a brand,\u201d she said.

An arrest warrant was issued on Wednesday for an actor who appeared for years as the Green Ranger in \u201cPower Rangers\u201d films and television shows, after a video showed him pushing a man in his 60s who used a walker, the police in Idaho said. The actor, Hector David Rivera, 35, was charged with misdemeanor battery in Idaho after video surfaced on Friday showing him in a dispute with the older man, said Carmen Boeger, a spokeswoman for the Nampa Police Department. Nampa is a city west of Boise with over 100,000 people. The video, captured on Friday on a bystander\u2019s dashboard camera, begins with a dispute over a parking spot between a man wearing a New England Patriots jersey and another who is using a walker. It ends with the first man shoving the other one to the ground before climbing into a black truck. He later drove away, the department said. The 14-second video has no audio and does not show the full interaction. But the truck appears to be parked in a space for people with disabilities, and Ms. Boeger said that the dispute began over a parking spot. The Nampa police identified Mr. Rivera by posting the video on the department\u2019s social media pages and asking the public for assistance, Ms. Boeger said. An arrest warrant was issued on Wednesday, and the victim\u2019s name was not released. \u201cOur community not only supports us but they support us going after people that commit crimes,\u201d Erick Moore, a Nampa police officer, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThey really stepped up and were able to help us get this identity pretty quick.\u201d The video was reported earlier by the Boise television station KTVB and other outlets. Mr. Rivera is a resident of Florida and Idaho, state records show. He was charged with a misdemeanor rather than a felony because the man he pushed told the police that he was not injured in the encounter, Ms. Boeger said. The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum sentence of six months upon conviction, and a maximum fine of $1,000. The search warrant and charges were not immediately available, and representatives for Mr. Rivera did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Rivera, whose stage name is Hector David Jr., played the Green Samurai Ranger in live-action television and film adaptations from 2011 to 2015. He also appeared in the movie \u201cPercy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief\u201d (2010), among other films and shows. He had been scheduled to speak at the Magic Valley Comic-Con festival this weekend in Twin Falls, Idaho, but was replaced after the parking lot incident, according to Larissa Long, the conference\u2019s executive director.  Aaron Hanania, the founder of Star Sync Appearances, a talent agency that represented Mr. Rivera, said in an email on Thursday that the company had removed Mr. Rivera from its client list. Court records show that Hector David Rivera Jr., 35, has been charged with other crimes in the past, including resisting arrest in Hillsborough County, Fla., in January 2023 and battery related to domestic violence in Broward County, Fla., a month later. It was not immediately clear if Mr. Rivera was convicted or served prison time. Kirsten Noyes contributed research.

The military said it was targeting Hezbollah infrastructure in villages close to the border that \u201cpose an immediate threat\u201d to communities in northern Israel, officials said. The invasion force consisted of small groups of commandos, accompanied by air cover as well as artillery shells fired from Israel. The plan could yet evolve into a larger invasion; thousands of additional troops have been deployed in northern Israel in recent days, leading to speculation about a broader and more prolonged operation. The ground operation followed intense Israeli strikes across Lebanon over the past two weeks that have killed hundreds of people, according to the Lebanese health ministry, including 95 yesterday. Israel is trying to force a conclusion to a yearlong war with Hezbollah that started in parallel with the war with Hamas in Gaza.

Credit...Guillem Casas\u00fas Supported by Hotshot Wall Street lawyers are now so in demand that bidding wars between firms for their services can resemble the frenzy among teams to sign star athletes. Eight-figure pay packages \u2014 rare a decade ago \u2014 are increasingly common for corporate lawyers at the top of their game, and many of these new heavy hitters have one thing in common: private equity. In recent years, highly profitable private equity giants like Apollo, Blackstone and KKR have moved beyond company buyouts into real estate, private lending, insurance and other businesses, amassing trillions of dollars in assets. As their demand for legal services has skyrocketed, they have become big revenue drivers for law firms. This is pushing up lawyers\u2019 pay across the industry, including at some of Wall Street\u2019s most prestigious firms, such as Kirkland & Ellis; Simpson Thacher & Bartlett; Davis Polk; Latham & Watkins; and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Lawyers with close ties to private equity increasingly enjoy pay and prestige similar to those of star lawyers who represent America\u2019s blue-chip companies and advise them on high-profile mergers, takeover battles and litigation. Numerous people compared it to a star-centric system like the N.B.A., but others worried that higher and higher pay had gotten out of hand and could strain the law firms forced to stretch their budgets to keep talent from leaving. \u201cTwenty million dollars is the new $10 million,\u201d said Sabina Lippman, a partner and co-founder of the legal recruiter Lippman Jungers. In the past few years, at least 10 law firms have spent \u2014 or acknowledged to Ms. Lippman that they need to spend \u2014 around $20 million a year or more to lure the highest-profile lawyers. One hiring partner at a law firm said $20 million pay packages were usually reserved for those who could bring in more than $100 million in annual revenue for a firm. Last year, six partners at Kirkland, including some who were recruited during the year, each made at least $25 million, according to people with knowledge of the arrangements who weren\u2019t authorized to discuss pay publicly. Several others in its London office made around $20 million. One partner at a law firm said pay for top lawyers had roughly tripled in the past five years. The take-home pay of some top lawyers is now approaching that of big bank chiefs. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank, made roughly $36 million last year. David Solomon of Goldman Sachs earned about $31 million over the same period. At the center of the action is Kirkland, a 115-year-old law firm founded in Chicago that made an early play for private equity clients when few rivals saw them as big moneymakers. About a decade ago, Kirkland began poaching heavy hitters at rival law firms \u2014 many based in New York \u2014 who had longstanding relationships with the biggest private equity players. That inspired fierce competition among top law firms, including Simpson, Latham, Davis Polk and Paul, Weiss. Some have changed their compensation structures or stretched their budgets to keep stars from leaving. Others have countered by raiding Kirkland to build their own private equity businesses. \u201cFirms do not feel like they can only think about being defensive with respect to their talent,\u201d said Scott Yaccarino, co-founder of the legal recruiting firm Empire Search Partners. \u201cThey have to be on the offense, too.\u201d Lawyers have earned multimillion-dollar pay packages for more than a decade. When Scott A. Barshay, one of the industry\u2019s pre-eminent mergers-and-acquisitions lawyers, left Cravath, Swaine & Moore to join Paul, Weiss in 2016, his pay package of $9.5 million created a stir in the industry. (Mr. Barshay\u2019s compensation has risen significantly since then, two people with knowledge of the contract said.) But the recent jump in pay has happened at a dizzying pace and for many more lawyers. Coupled with the fierce poaching, it is swiftly reshaping the economics of major law firms. Kirkland has even guaranteed some hires fixed shares in the partnership for several years, according to several people with knowledge of the contracts. In some instances, it has extended forgivable loans as sweeteners. Last year, Kirkland hired away Alvaro Membrillera, a noted private equity lawyer in London who counts KKR as a key client, from Paul, Weiss for around $14 million and a multiyear guarantee, according to two people with knowledge of the contract.  White & Case recently hired O. Keith Hallam III, a partner from Cravath with private equity clients, for roughly $14 million a year, according to a person with knowledge of the contract. The firm also hired Taurie M. Zeitzer, a private equity lawyer at Paul, Weiss, for around the same amount, another person with knowledge of the contract said. To some, the changing landscape represents a more meritocratic system in which partners can expect pay based on talent rather than seniority. Cravath, a storied, 205-year-old firm, long followed the so-called lock-step system linked to seniority, but modified it in 2021. Debevoise & Plimpton is one of the few remaining firms that continue to follow the lock-step model. \u201cLaw firms have gotten a lot more commercial in how they run themselves,\u201d said Neil Barr, the chair and managing partner of Davis Polk. \u201cFirms are operating like businesses rather than old-school partnerships, and it\u2019s led to more rational business behavior.\u201d Kirkland\u2019s early bet on private equity has paid off handsomely. Globally, private equity firms managed $8.7 trillion in assets in 2023 \u2014 more than five times what they oversaw at the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, according to the data provider Preqin. Blackstone alone manages more than $1 trillion in assets, and other firms, including Apollo, Ares, KKR and Brookfield, collectively oversee trillions more. As the private equity business took off, Kirkland\u2019s clients began directing hundreds of millions of dollars in business its way each year. In 2023, Kirkland made more than $7 billion in gross revenue, according to The American Lawyer\u2019s annual ranking, making it the highest-grossing law firm in the world. A single firm like Blackstone or KKR can generate legal work from the constellation of companies, banks and others in its universe. For instance, even though Blackstone\u2019s main law firm is Simpson, it paid Kirkland \u2014 one of its secondary law firms \u2014 $41.6 million in 2023, according to a regulatory filing. \u201cThe private equity clients of these firms \u2014 they mint money,\u201d said Mark Rosen, the chief executive and chairman of the legal recruiting firm Mark Bruce International. Simpson, an illustrious Wall Street firm with roots in the Gilded Age and one of the largest private equity practices, has been a particular target of poaching by Kirkland. One person with knowledge of the rivalry called the firm Kirkland\u2019s \u201cfarm team.\u201d Kate Slaasted, a spokeswoman for Kirkland, said in an email: \u201cAs a firm, we have the highest regard for Simpson Thacher.\u201d At least seven top partners from Simpson, including Andrew Calder and Peter Martelli, have jumped to Kirkland in the past decade. Kirkland also poached Jennifer S. Perkins, a star lawyer from Latham who has represented KKR on some of its deals, to join its private equity practice. Mr. Calder and Jon A. Ballis, the chairman of Kirkland, were among the partners who made at least $25 million last year, according to three people with knowledge of the compensation details. Mr. Calder and Melissa D. Kalka, also a partner at Kirkland, work closely with Global Infrastructure Partners, the private equity firm that recently announced a deal to sell itself to BlackRock for $12.5 billion. In 2023, Paul, Weiss \u2014 which counts Apollo Global Management among its top clients and is aggressively building its private equity business \u2014 poached several Kirkland lawyers to build out its London office. The firm also hired Eric J. Wedel, whose clients include Bain Capital, KKR and Warburg Pincus, away from Kirkland, and Jim Langston, another private equity-focused lawyer, from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Simpson has altered its pay structure in the past year so that it can be more competitive with Kirkland and other rivals. \u201cWe intentionally made the decision to adjust our compensation structure to attract and retain the best talent in strategically important practices across our global platform,\u201d Alden Millard, chair of Simpson\u2019s executive committee, wrote in an email. One sign of the frenzied nature of hiring: the use of multiyear compensation guarantees to attract lawyers. These fell out of favor after Dewey & LeBoeuf filed for bankruptcy in 2012, unable to meet millions of dollars in fixed payments and bonuses it had promised partners. Now, a different type of guaranteed payment has become popular. Some firms are awarding new hires a number of shares in the partnership for a set period, typically in the range of two to five years. Such offers are attractive because they ensure a specific share of a firm\u2019s profits irrespective of its annual performance. This frenzy has meant that even lawyers without private equity connections have seen their pay rise. Freshfields \u2014 a big British firm that is building a beachhead in the United States \u2014 has recruited lawyers in the range of $10 million to $15 million, and provided additional pay guarantees to some, according to three people with direct knowledge of the compensation details. \u201cLaw firms want people who are going to be motivated based on culture,\u201d said Ms. Lippman, the recruiter. \u201cBut at some point if you have this big difference between firms, everyone has a price.\u201d Maureen Farrell writes about Wall Street, focusing on private equity, hedge funds and billionaires and how they influence the world of investing.

Other neighbors also worry about allowing potential naval access to the Red Sea. Reporting from Nairobi, Kenya The government of landlocked Ethiopia has signed a preliminary agreement with Somaliland, a self-declared breakaway republic in northwestern Somalia, granting Ethiopia commercial and military access to the territory\u2019s gateway to the Red Sea \u2014 a port deal that threatens to inflame tensions in the tumultuous Horn of Africa region. In a memorandum of understanding signed with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia on Monday, the leader of Somaliland, Muse Bihi Abdi, said he would lease more than 12 miles of sea access for 50 years to the Ethiopian Navy. In return, Ethiopia would formally recognize Somaliland as an independent nation, a move that Mr. Abdi said would set \u201ca precedent as the first nation to extend international recognition to our country.\u201d The New York Times Somaliland would also get a stake in the state-owned Ethiopian Airlines, Mr. Abiy\u2019s national security adviser, Redwan Hussien, said during the deal\u2019s announcement. He did not provide further details. The agreement for access to the Somaliland port of Berbera is not legally binding but, after extensive negotiations in the coming months, it could lead to an enforceable treaty between the two parties. Here\u2019s a look at why the agreement matters. The pact has rattled the Horn of Africa area, which is already encumbered by civil war, political wrangling and widespread humanitarian crises. Observers say the agreement could also provoke further tensions in the Red Sea, a vital global shipping route that has become increasingly dangerous amid the Israel-Hamas war.

Sal Strazzullo, a Brooklyn lawyer, was the legal king of New York nightlife, with a client list that extended to nightclub proprietors, disc jockeys, exotic dancers and doormen. But when he was charged with stealing more than $1 million from clients last December, the man known for sleek double-breasted suits and luxury watches needed a lawyer of his own: a court-appointed attorney for the indigent. The indictment, which stunned friends and colleagues, only hinted at the extent of Mr. Strazzullo\u2019s troubles. Four months later, he was hit with a second set of charges and a score of lawsuits, legal filings that accused him of bilking his clients of millions of dollars. In August, it all came to an end. Mr. Strazzullo, 52, was found dead in a black Fiat convertible behind his parents\u2019 home in Bath Beach, Brooklyn, just days before he was due back in court. The death appeared to be a suicide, a law enforcement official said.

  "2025-04-26_9550_1": "Supported by A tongue-twisting rap by a Berlin duo has spotlighted Germans\u2019 love of their springtime produce. Now if only they could find a rhyme for asparagus. Sarah Maslin Nir reported from Germany, including from an asparagus theme park. In the past month, millions of people have found themselves stumbling through the contorted and catchy syllables of a song about, of all things, a woman named Barbara and some rhubarb-loving barbarians who drink beer while getting their beards barbered. In German. Or more rightly: Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbier. The hyper-compound words of the popular German tongue twister about Barbara, her \u201cbombastic\u201d rhubarb cake and her hirsute customers shot to inexplicable and extreme popularity this spring, a few months after a pair of comedic musical content creators from Berlin posted a rap version late last year. Their silly ditty has more than 47 million views on TikTok; for a brief moment on some online streaming charts, Barbara beat out Beyonc\u00e9. Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cThere is a prejudice that, first, Germans don\u2019t have any sense of humor, and second, they do not have fun, and third, their language sounds very aggressive,\u201d said Bodo Wartke, the rap\u2019s lyricist who, along with Marti Fischer, the composer, created the viral \u201cBarbara\u2019s Rhubarb Bar\u201d tune. They spoke on a recent day in their Berlin studio as they giggled and tripped over their own stanzas \u2014 which exploit a feature of German grammar that crams nouns together into strings of syllables. \u201cAnd we proved them all wrong,\u201d Mr. Wartke said. But lost in translation, as global copycats stumble through the alliterative story of Barbara, the bar she opens and the pie that made her famous, is a quirk not only of language, but also of German gastronomical culture. Rhubarb is much more than a word in German that sounds a lot like \u201cBarbara\u201d; it is an object of springtime fixation, part of a nationwide fanaticism for eating a small group of particular produce exactly in season. Put another way: Song or no song, every spring across Germany, rhubarb goes completely viral. The vegetable (yes, it is a vegetable) is part of a trio of produce that includes strawberries and a particular asparagus varietal that peaks in early spring. Warm weather sets off a frenzy for all things featuring them in a country that still adheres to consumption along the rhythms of the seasons.

  "2025-04-26_313680_1": "The penny may seem like a harmless coin. But few things symbolize our national dysfunction more than the inability to stop minting this worthless currency. Supported by Few things symbolize our national dysfunction as much as this accursed coin, which we mint by the millions because it\u2019s too worthless to spend. Caity Weaver is a staff writer for the magazine. For her reporting of this article, she visited the Treasury, the United States Mint, the Library of Congress, the National Portrait Gallery and the coin vault at the National Museum of American History. I was disappointed to learn, recently, that the United States has created for itself a logistical problem so stupendously stupid, one cannot help wondering if it is wise to continue to allow this nation to supervise the design of its own holiday postage stamps, let alone preside over the administration of an extensive Interstate highway system or nuclear arsenal. It\u2019s the dumbest thing I ever heard. I have come to think of it as the Perpetual Penny Paradox. Most pennies produced by the U.S. Mint are given out as change but never spent; this creates an incessant demand for new pennies to replace them, so that cash transactions that necessitate pennies (i.e., any concluding with a sum whose final digit is 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 or 9) can be settled. Because these replacement pennies will themselves not be spent, they will need to be replaced with new pennies that will also not be spent, and so will have to be replaced with new pennies that will not be spent, which will have to be replaced by new pennies (that will not be spent, and so will have to be replaced). In other words, we keep minting pennies because no one uses the pennies we mint. A conservative estimate holds that there are 240 billion pennies lying around the United States \u2014 about 724 ($7.24) for every man, woman and child there residing, and enough to hand two pennies to every bewildered human born since the dawn of man. (To distribute them all, in fact, we\u2019d have to double back to the beginning and give our first six billion ancestors a third American penny.) These are but a fraction of the several hundreds of billions of pennies issued since 1793, most of which have suffered a mysterious fate sometimes described in government records, with a hint of supernaturality generally undesirable in bookkeeping, as \u201cdisappearance.\u201d As far as anyone knows, the American cent is the most produced coin in the history of civilization, its portrait of Lincoln the most reproduced piece of art on Earth. Although pennies are almost never used for their ostensible purpose (to make purchases), right now one out of every two circulating coins minted in the United States has a face value of 1 cent. A majority of the ones that have not yet disappeared are, according to a 2022 report, \u201csitting in consumers\u2019 coin jars in their homes.\u201d It\u2019s crucial that they remain there. Five years ago, Mint officials conceded that if even a modest portion of these dormant pennies were suddenly to return to circulation, the resulting flow-back would be \u201clogistically unmanageable.\u201d There would be so unbelievably many pennies that there most likely would not be enough room to contain them inside government vaults. Moving them from place to place would be time-consuming, cumbersome and costly. (Just $100 worth of pennies weighs a touch over 55 pounds.) With each new penny minted, this problem becomes slightly more of a problem. The United States government has willfully ignored this nonsensical math problem for decades. Forty-eight years ago, in letters to Congress, William E. Simon, then the Treasury secretary, begged lawmakers to \u201cgive serious consideration\u201d to abandoning 1-cent coins as soon as possible. The frantic tempo at which pennies were plummeting out of circulation, a Treasury report warned, would soon plunge the Mint into \u201ca never-ending spiral\u201d of \u201cever-increasing production\u201d as it flailed to replace unused pennies with more pennies that would likewise remain unused \u2014 a bit like deploying a bucket to combat a dripping ceiling leak, and it turns out the leak is the ocean because the room was built under the sea, and the only way out of this anyone can think of is to engineer increasingly large buckets. The coin should be eradicated, the report reasoned, \u201cno later than 1980.\u201d Twenty-five years ago, Philip Diehl, then the director of the United States Mint, stated that \u201ctwo-thirds of the pennies produced in the last 30 years\u201d \u2014 1969 to 1999 \u2014 had \u201cdropped out of circulation.\u201d So even at a time when three-quarters of Americans\u2019 payments were still settled with cash, pennies were not being spent. A 2022 Federal Reserve survey found that Americans paid with cash just 18 percent of the time. It\u2019s impossible to know how many of those transactions might have involved coins, let alone pennies; the Fed doesn\u2019t even try to track this. One thing we know for sure about America\u2019s 1-cent coins, however, is that just one of them costs more than 3 cents to produce. Why, in 2024, does our nation still spew out pennies like a two-liter in eternal agitation, gushing undrinkable fizz? The people I asked (government officials, numismatists, economists, scientists, scrap-metal industrialists, souvenir-elongated-penny machinists, historians, businesspeople, poverty researchers, Canadians) assigned blame widely: to an uninterested Congress; to highly interested lobbyists; to the sentimental; to people bad at math; to a populace willing to provide, in perpetuity, free private storage for pointless copper-plated tokens. (This last group encompasses every person currently possessed of at least one penny.) But the truth about why Americans are doomed to trudge eternally through a blood-scented bog of pennies-as-currency may be simultaneously the most dispiriting and encouraging reason imaginable: We may have forgotten that we don\u2019t have to. The necessity of abolishing the penny has been obvious to those in power for so long that the inability to accomplish it has transformed the coin into a symbol of deeper rot. Eleven years ago, President Barack Obama called the penny \u201ca good metaphor for some of the larger problems\u201d of the U.S. government. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get rid of things that don\u2019t work,\u201d Obama said, adding that eliminating the penny is something a president (for example: Barack Obama, 11 years ago) would \u201cneed legislation\u201d for. When Robert Whaples, an economist at Wake Forest University, published an article in 2006 about the imperative to eliminate America\u2019s 1-cent coin, he received a personal note: \u201cGet it done, and you will deserve the Nobel Prize!\u201d The note was from Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, in which capacity he technically oversaw the annual ordering of billions of pennies from the Mint for distribution among the American populace. \u201cAt the policy level,\u201d Philip Diehl, who served as the 35th director of the Mint, from 1994 to 2000, told me by phone, \u201cI think everybody agrees this is ridiculous.\u201d \u201cI went to Congress saying, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m losing $90 million a year on pennies,\u2019\u201d recalled Edmund Moy, the Mint\u2019s 38th director, from 2006 to 2011. \u201cI said, \u2018You guys need to pass a law forcing me to change it.\u2019\u201d Steve Stivers, a congressman from Ohio\u2019s 15th District, led multiple unsuccessful attempts to revise coinage laws while serving in the House from 2011 to 2021. (He hoped to enjoin the Mint to make pennies out of cold-rolled American steel, something they happen to produce a lot of in Ohio.) Stivers attributed his bills\u2019 failures to \u201ca reluctance to change, and this idea that we had to study every little thing before they would even think about a change.\u201d He was particularly irked that a Mint-commissioned study on alternative cent compositions concluded, in part, that there would be no major savings if pennies were minted from stainless steel. \u201cWe weren\u2019t proposing stainless steel, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Stivers exclaimed from his office in Columbus. (He is now the president of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.) \u201cStainless steel is a lot more expensive!\u201d I consulted Andrew Von Ah, who, as a physical-infrastructure analyst for the Government Accountability Office, has examined our physical-currency program in scrupulous detail and is better positioned than most to explain why the United States still makes pennies. \u201cThere\u2019s no great reason why,\u201d he said. The recursive and maddening logic of penny-making is embedded in the coin\u2019s very name. The value represented by what modern Americans now call \u201cpennies\u201d was counted by English colonists in \u201cpence\u201d; \u201cpence\u201d was a contraction of an older English word: \u201cpennies.\u201d Officially, American colonists followed the British system, which divided a pound into \u2014 sure, why not? \u2014 240 parts. In practice, though, America\u2019s \u201cmoney\u201d was a mutating mishmash incorporating Spanish silver dollars (known as \u201cpieces of eight\u201d; they could be physically chopped into \u2014 sure, why not? \u2014 eight equal \u201cbits\u201d to make change), beaver skins, tobacco leaves, wampum and (frequently worthless) slips of paper. Years before America inaugurated its first president, Thomas Jefferson urged that the denominations of a nationwide currency be reconfigured until they were as moronically easy to understand as possible: Everything done by tens. In 1784, he proposed a dollar for the nation\u2019s base unit, because Spanish silver dollars were so popular that people already understood how much a dollar bought. (As Treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton recommended decimal coin names: \u201cdisme\u201d from the Latin decimus for the one-tenth; \u201ccent,\u201d from centum, for the one-hundredth.) Spanish influence survives in our 25-cent piece, a denomination representing \u201ctwo bits\u201d \u2014 one-quarter \u2014 of a Spanish dollar. One or two bits \u2014 12\u00bd cents or 25 cents \u2014 were, for many years, \u201cextremely popular\u201d prices for little items like hairbrushes or handkerchiefs, says Jesse Kraft, a curator of American numismatics at the American Numismatic Society. Ultra-inexpensive stuff cost a couple of pennies \u2014 or would have, if there had been enough to go around. But a lack of small change circulating during the country\u2019s infancy made it tricky to buy or sell individual items cheaply. So urgent was the crisis that the Mint was the first public building erected by federal law, on the site of an abandoned whiskey distillery in Philadelphia. It was guarded at night by a sword-bearing man and a \u201csavage\u201d dog (cost: $3) that no one but he was allowed to feed, lest it become sweet. Today pennies are still minted in Philadelphia and in Denver. The Mint\u2019s official reason for minting pennies is that the Federal Reserve orders them. Specifically, the Federal Reserve \u201cbuys\u201d coins from the Mint at face value and stores them in bags all over the United States for distribution to banks. I hoped to watch the birth of a new cohort of pennies in person, but a Mint press representative insisted to me that he and other Mint professionals had \u201cno idea\u201d when or where the Mint would ever be making pennies \u2014 that these people could not narrow it down by day, or even week, at either facility. Did this mean, I asked, that it was standard procedure at the largest coin-making operation on Earth (Philadelphia), which last year minted more than two billion pennies, to decide \u201cday of\u201d which of six possible denominations it was going to produce? \u201cYeah,\u201d he said \u2014 though, to be fair, there is vanishingly little proof he was paying attention to what either of us was saying. (The press representative later clarified that the Philadelphia Mint does not decide which coins to produce \u201cday of.\u201d) I gleaned more substantive details from a retired Mint spokesman: Tom Jurkowsky, who led corporate communications for the Mint from 2009 to 2017. Jurkowsky felt that, during his tenure, the public-relations strategy within the Treasury Department, which oversees the Mint, was to avoid drawing attention to the penny\u2019s zombie survival. Officials dreaded public ire if a critical mass of Americans should ever notice the irrationality of the production statistics and come face to face with the truth: \u201cHow silly it is,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much money it costs to produce pennies.\u201d Nearly every former federal official I interviewed about America\u2019s interminable penny production pointed a finger at a small private company in Greeneville, Tenn., called Artazn. For 43 years, Artazn has held contracts with the Treasury Department to manufacture the zinc \u201cblanks\u201d that the Mint stamps into 1-cent coins. These contracts have earned it more than $1 billion in revenue since 2008 alone. Jurkowsky cited the company\u2019s lobbying efforts as the No. 1 reason that coin-reform bills die in Congress. That may be true in terms of explicit dollar allocation, but political inertia has done even more to help Artazn\u2019s cause, for free. According to the government transparency group OpenSecrets.org, since 2006 the company has spent less than $3 million \u2014 a charmingly modest amount \u2014 on coin-related lobbying. The story of the Artazn contract begins in an age of spiking copper prices: the early 1970s. America\u2019s pennies, then still 95 percent copper, suddenly began vanishing \u2014 though not for the accepted reasons (worthlessness, pointlessness) pennies disappear today. These were vanishing because they had suddenly become valuable and even useful. The Secret Service confiscated a cache of cents from a General Electric plant in Kentucky, where they were being punched through and sneaked into appliances as cheaper substitutes for copper washers. McDonald\u2019s paid customers to bring them in; at some locations, a person could trade in 100 pennies and receive a dollar, plus a dime and a nickel. Fearing endless cycles of hoarding and penny ransom, Congress sought a new base metal for the coins. It would have to be cheaper than copper. It would need to withstand the trauma of being near keys in a pocket (a condition researchers dutifully replicated by rotating coins and keys inside a cotton-lined drum). Because a portion of America\u2019s children will, inevitably, swallow her currency, it should be detectable by X-ray.  The new coins, it was suggested, could be almost 98 percent zinc, with a copper coating to ensure that they still looked like pennies. The zinc industry loved this idea. The Copper and Brass Fabricators Council sued the Department of Treasury \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to prevent its implementation. The camps clashed over whether the proposed coins would, essentially, self-destruct. Copper is exceptionally resistant to corrosion. In theory, then, a zinc object that is entirely and perfectly encased within copper will corrode slowly. But pennies\u2019 thin copper plating is easily scratched \u2014 and, for esoteric but indisputable metallurgical reasons, exposed zinc that is adjacent to copper can corrode rapidly. \u201cFrom a corrosion perspective,\u201d said Suveen Mathaudhu, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines, \u201cit doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d Online forums whose bailiwicks are the diverse manifestations of humans\u2019 eternal pursuit of shiny items (metal detection, coin collection, etc.) are littered with images of modern pennies disintegrating from the inside out. Gathered from backyards and beaches, they are pitted, covered in chalky scabs or possessed of an element foreign to most circles: corners. Some have holes clean through them. Aficionados employ a derogatory term for the post-1982 pennies that often resemble artifacts dredged up from Aegean shipwrecks. They call them \u201czincolns.\u201d We were warned about all of this. In March 1981, an engineer from the Copper Development Association told Congress that the proposed apposition of copper and zinc in pennies represented \u201cthe worst possible arrangement\u201d from a corrosion standpoint. Congress approved it anyway. But because the U.S. Mint, which had made all coins in-house since 1792, was unequipped to produce zinc discs electroplated with copper, the manufacture of penny blanks was outsourced. In July 1981, the Treasury awarded its first multimillion-dollar contract for this work to the metal and chemical division of the Ball Corporation, makers of the famous glass jars (crowned with less famous screw tops, made from zinc). Today\u2019s coin-blanking operation is a division of a private-equity-owned portfolio company that was sold off after becoming part of a conglomerate after being spun off from a previous Ball subsidiary into an independent company; names along the way have included Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing (in the 1880s), Jarden (named after jars) and, today, Artazn (climaxing with the chemical symbol for zinc). Artazn largess has helped secure the URL \u201cpennies.org\u201d and finance the creation of the official webpage of \u201cAmericans for Common Cents,\u201d a self-styled \u201corganization\u201d that essentially consists of just one man, a Washington lobbyist named Mark Weller. In Weller\u2019s capacity as executive director of Americans for Common Cents, he has testified before Congress, been cited in government reports and written nationally circulated editorials. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but the arguments he makes in favor of continued penny production are well represented on the Americans for Common Cents website, an invaluable propaganda armory for penny-manufacture zealots. The website\u2019s \u201cPenny Myths and Facts\u201d page reproduces one of the organization\u2019s most passionate assertions: \u201cThe penny aids charities in raising hundreds of millions of dollars each year for important causes.\u201d I contacted the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, which Weller describes as relying \u201csignificantly on small, yet critical penny contributions,\u201d to inquire about its coin dependence. Coker Powell, the organization\u2019s executive vice president and chief revenue officer, told me that the society has discontinued physical coin-collection programs, which had become increasingly costly. Donations of spare change had slowed in recent decades, she said. Fortunately, despite a dearth of pennies, the nuclear winter for charity forecast by Americans for Common Cents did not crystallize. Soliciting donations in the form of \u201croundups\u201d (and add-ons) to credit-card transactions, Powell said, has proved \u201cmuch more lucrative\u201d than coin gathering ever did. So who really needs these coins? The poor, Weller claims \u2014 \u201cpeople with relatively low incomes (particularly the young, elderly and minorities),\u201d who use cash more frequently than high-income earners; also, \u201c\u2018unbanked\u2019 Americans\u201d who \u201chave no other option.\u201d Sociologists I consulted whose fieldwork examines the economics of American poverty challenged this notion. Carrying around \u201cbundles\u201d of hundreds of pennies to purchase, say, a beverage \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem feasible,\u201d said Jacob Faber, a professor at New York University who studies inequality. And the cashless economy has ballooned in the last decade. Sarah Halpern-Meekin, a sociologist at the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told me that \u201cthe majority\u201d of people with low incomes make cashless transactions \u2014 on apps like Cash App, for instance. Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, pays employees who do not provide banking info with Walmart-branded debit cards. Plasma banks often distribute payments in the form of prepaid debit cards. It\u2019s true that cash usage is highest among households with the lowest incomes; neither expert suggested that it was obsolete or unpopular. But if significant numbers of Americans rely on penny coins to make purchases, there is no evidence of it. If the importance of a money-furnishing institution correlates with the quantity of money it furnishes to the public, the U.S. Mint matters far less to Americans than the private company Coinstar, whose kiosks annually disgorge about twice as many coins into circulation as do government coin presses. Yet Coinstar not only exists but thrives \u2014 and not only thrives but is indispensable to the American money supply chain \u2014 solely because, every year, the United States elects to issue a portion of its currency in a format that a majority of Americans deem inconvenient for most uses: little metal discs. For a fee, Coinstar transfigures these discs into the other, more popular formats in which the bulk of U.S. currency is issued: paper bills or electronic payments. The setup works basically the same as if the United States issued a portion of its legal tender encased in an inch-thick layer of Saran wrap and Coinstar\u2019s machines provided an instantaneous Saran-wrap-removal service that anyone could pay to use. Since debuting in 1992, Coinstar machines have processed over one trillion little metal discs of various denominations, worth a whisper under $67 billion. Say an American upends a Big Gulp of coins worth $25 into a kiosk at a Fiesta Mart in Houston. Each dumped coin flashes before a sensor that, in a fraction of a second, analyzes its metal content; this compositional analysis reveals its denomination, which the machine tallies before plinking it into a bin at the kiosk\u2019s base. After every coin has plunked, Coinstar takes a service fee (say, 12.5 percent) and maybe a transaction fee (say, $0.59) to return something like $21.28 in (mostly) bills. Over the course of roughly 22 days, about 550 pounds of loose coins will plonk into the belly of the Fiesta Mart kiosk, at which point \u2014 once it is at least 90 percent full \u2014 the machine will alert dispatch: Time to harvest the coin crop. From Fiesta Mart, the coins are trucked to a regional processing center, where they are divided by denomination. Most end up inside enormous white cubes, called ballistic bags, many of which are distributed into locked cages designated by bank. When a ballistic bag of pennies is deposited into a, say, Bank of America cage, Bank of America sends Coinstar an electronic deposit equal to the value of its mammoth coin cube. Now say a store in Katy, Texas, needs pennies. It can call its bank, say, Bank of America, to request a delivery. Bank of America calls them up from the cube and has them sausaged into 50-penny rolls and dropped off. Upon arrival at the store in Katy, the rolled pennies are dumped into a compartment of a register\u2019s cash drawer, where they will remain piled until they are handed over as change in a cash transaction \u2014 whence, statistically speaking, they will most likely find their way into another cup, cup holder or other theoretically accessible (but, in practice, rarely accessed) location. Counting their initial trip in the Big Gulp, these pennies will have changed custody five times, and taken multiple car rides, to facilitate the absolute least important part of one transaction. The pandemic annihilated this cycle. Erstwhile commuters had no reason to feed coins into parking meters, bus fare boxes and tollbooths; even when they did leave the house, millions of people, determined to spend as little time as possible in enclosed public spaces, stopped pausing on their errands to redeem their change at Coinstar machines. Coinstar deposits dropped by 60 percent at the start of the pandemic. As a result, banks, which rely on Coinstar to choreograph the nationwide coin-recirculation ballet, received 60 percent fewer coins than usual. Signs soon bloomed along the windows and checkout lanes of American businesses, prevailing upon customers to pay with either credit or debit cards, or exact change, because of a nationwide \u201ccoin shortage.\u201d In fact, the country still had all the coins it needed for making change. The problem was that they were sitting in jars and pockets and cup holders. Pennies, in particular, were not returning to businesses. This is because Coinstar is practically the sole medium by which the pennies churned out with trochilidine vigor by the Mint migrate around the United States. Coinstar\u2019s Kelly green kiosks could already be found in most major American cities when its current chief executive, Kevin McColly, joined the company more than 20 years ago. McColly\u2019s job, he said, was to figure out \u201chow to get to Scranton, Pa.; how to get to Chattanooga, Tenn.; how to open Alaska.\u201d Today, 92 percent of Americans live within five miles of one of some 18,000 Coinstar machines. The early genius of Coinstar was that it charged people a little for something they could get for free: their own money, counted. Dealing with coins was enough of a hassle that people were willing to pay a machine to do it on their behalf. So, it turned out, were banks. Myriad financial institutions that previously processed customers\u2019 coins directly, gratis, now outsource that time-consuming task to Coinstar. (Except in Minnesota, which McColly described as \u201chistorically a bad state\u201d for Coinstar; owing to their ferocious commitment to Midwestern friendliness, he said, a disproportionate number of Minnesotan bank locations still handle coins for free.) But even people who bother to deposit the spare change they accrue \u2014 who represent only a portion of people who accrue spare change \u2014 are losing interest in redeeming 1-cent coins. Every year, McColly said, the value of the average Coinstar deposit creeps up, because people are depositing fewer pennies. Pennies still constitute the plurality of coins in a deposit \u2014 most recently about 49 percent of the average jar \u2014 but 15 years ago, the jars were more than half pennies. Pennies in any quantity occupy disproportionate space; at 49 percent of a jar, they contribute only about 6 percent of its value. For one person, that\u2019s annoying. For Coinstar, it\u2019s a major expense. Half the haul it\u2019s schlepping from the Fiesta Mart kiosk \u2014 i.e., 225 pounds, out of 550 pounds of coins total \u2014 is just pennies. Coinstar makes the same amount of money counting the same coins over and over as it does counting brand-new coins for the first time. It doesn\u2019t help Coinstar if the Mint makes shiny pennies that no one troubles to keep track of; it\u2019s much more important, for Coinstar, that people save (and then exchange) their coins. Nevertheless, if the United States simply stopped making pennies, McColly said, \u201cthere would be hardly any impact on Coinstar.\u201d McColly has even proposed to people within the government that his network of machines could eliminate the hassle and expense of making new pennies, by helping existing ones circulate more easily, for a fraction of the production cost. \u201cI\u2019ve had very frank conversations with both the Mint and the Fed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are so \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the right way to say this is, because I know I\u2019m talking to a reporter.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt\u2019s just not very efficient, how they manage that process.\u201d Americans accumulate pennies not because we desire them but because we are entitled to them. If we pay for something in cash with more than exact change, we expect to receive back the difference; if the difference ends in any number other than 0 or 5, we will receive at least one penny. We are entitled to pennies because they exist. But imagine a world where they didn\u2019t. Imagine a world where it was Canada. Many Americans will be surprised to learn that Canada eliminated its 1-cent coin more than a decade ago. Canadians are aware of this \u2014 how little Americans know of their world, and how bewildering it must seem in the rare instances we contemplate it. When I interviewed Canadians about their abolition of the penny, I often sensed from their responses that they were handling me gently. \u201cOur country,\u201d one official from the Royal Canadian Mint informed me with an almost apologetic smile, \u201cis just as big as yours.\u201d For all I know, he could be right. Canada got rid of its penny in 2013 because it cost 1.6 cents to produce and had, like its American cousin, become essentially worthless. Here is the most important detail to understand: Canada eliminated only its physical coin, not the mathematical concept of 1 cent. Payment by credit card, debit card, mobile phone or check \u2014 any kind of noncash transaction \u2014 is calculated exactly as it was before the penny was abolished. If, after tax, a bill comes to, say, $20.11, a Canadian paying by credit card will be charged $20.11. A Canadian paying by cash can expect to pay $20.10. The final digit of Canadian cash transactions is rounded to the nearest nickel: 1 and 2, nearest to 0 nickels, round down to 0; 3 and 4 round up to a nickel \u2014 5; 6 and 7, also nearest to one nickel, round down \u2014 5 again; 8 and 9, nearest to 10 cents, round up. I admit that the thought I might be asked to pay, say, $3.80 (cash) for something that, according to the laws of God and man, has been calculated to cost $3.79 (cash) is not only reflexively infuriating to me but a potential source of permanent confusion. The Canadian government mitigated one of those problems (no hope for the other) with an information campaign that included signs with simple charts dividing potential prices into two columns: \u201cRound down\u201d and \u201cRound up.\u201d I asked Karl Littler from the Retail Council of Canada if there were still signs at cash registers explaining the rounding. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 years now, so even the most obtuse people have pretty much figured it out,\u201d he said, and laughed. Although they hardly ever use penny coins, fears of being deprived of one to two per transaction are a knee-jerk concern for Americans invited to contemplate a hypothetical world without them. Rounding opponents point out that a disproportionate number of prices end in double nines, e.g., a $5.99 gallon of milk. Retail legend claims that the \u201codd cents\u201d pricing strategy (a Parisian trick imported by Rowland H. Macy to his New York City dry-goods store) proliferated after the cash register\u2019s invention in 1879, as a tactic to prevent sales clerks from stealing. If a customer paid $3 for a $3 item, the logic went, a cashier could stealthily pocket the bills; if the price was $2.99, the customer would be owed a coin; to open the register, the cashier would need to key in the sale, thus creating, within the register\u2019s hidden recesses, an incorruptible record of the transaction. That consumers tend to associate these prices with better deals (incorrectly, according to studies) was an added benefit. But while it is theoretically possible that a retailer could see a surplus profit of up to 2 cents on every transaction, the number of variables that need to be precisely manipulated to pull off the feat would require such convoluted mathematical and psychological calculations that it stretches credulity to suppose anyone would bother. In 2007, Robert Whaples, the Wake Forest economist, analyzed tens of thousands of transactions from a convenience-store chain to see whether cash-register totals would tend to be rounded up more often than down. \u201cThe last digit\u2019s pretty random,\u201d Whaples said. Averages worked out in customers\u2019 favor about as often as they didn\u2019t. But also, the gains and losses in question amounted, in the aggregate, to fractions of a penny either way, so why are we even talking about it? \u201cI\u2019ve yet to find somebody who\u2019s off skiing in Gstaad because of the extra money that they made on the penny,\u201d Karl Littler said. Although Canadians were not required to cash in their cents, based on statistics from New Zealand and Australia (divorced from pennies since 1989 and 1992), officials anticipated that Canadians would choose to return lots of them. Explaining the transportation of more than 44 million pounds of pennies across Canada, rumored to be a quite large country, visibly tickles Anthony Rotondo, the Mint\u2019s senior manager of domestic circulation. (The Royal Canadian Mint has achieved such international renown in coin production that about 80 other countries have paid it to make their coins. No other countries hire the United States to make their coins.) Trucking obsolete cents from financial institutions to their final recycling site required 1,200 trips in tractor-trailers. The penny metal was sold to help cover such costs. At the recycling site, cents were deposited onto a conveyor belt. Plated steel pennies \u2014 minted in Canada for 12 years \u2014 flew up to a gigantic magnet, leaving only copper-alloy and copper-plated zinc coins behind. \u201cCopper and zinc are very hard to separate,\u201d Rotondo said; uncoupling them required \u201ca special million-dollar machine\u201d that creates a field of artificial gravity inside a tank, in which zinc floats and copper sinks. Canada\u2019s pennies were mostly copper, \u201clucky for us,\u201d Rotondo said. \u201cCopper is typically worth three to four times what zinc is worth.\u201d Were the United States to ever round up its pennies, our hoard would be predominantly zinc; since 1982, we\u2019ve made about 2.1 billion pounds of them. Unlucky for us. The words Canadian officials used to describe their recycling of, to date, nearly eight billion pennies are not ones typically associated with undertakings on the national scale in the United States: \u201csuccess\u201d; \u201cvery smooth\u201d; \u201cnot an issue\u201d; \u201ca nice story.\u201d But in addition to working with a population about one-ninth that of the United States, the Canadians had a hidden advantage. Their mint shepherds its coins through every stage of their life cycle: forecasting the need for them, producing them, distributing them, recirculating them and retiring them. In the United States, these responsibilities are divided among a hodgepodge of public and private entities. The wisdom of Canada\u2019s system \u2014 in which the coin people handle all the coin stuff \u2014 was spotlighted during Covid lockdowns. The natural flow of coins was similarly interrupted across both countries: public-transit usage receded; reliance on self-checkout machines, which require up to three times the amount of coins to operate as standard checkouts, surged. But in Canada, there were no signs of any coin shortage. Within the United States, it is accepted that the Treasury Department will relentlessly flood the penny-sogged nation with nuisance pennies until Congress passes a law to stop it from doing so. But how could such legislation ever, reasonably, be proposed? Pennies are not even important relative to other American minor coins, let alone in comparison to, for instance, the rights of man. Vaporizing every single penny would have virtually no effect on the amount of money we have in circulation. They are worth so little that almost no one I approached \u2014 including representatives for the entities that make and distribute them \u2014 was able, or willing, to discuss them. Compounding this lack of interest is the sobering fact that the government would not necessarily save a fortune by not making pennies. Because it costs the Mint less than 10 cents to produce dimes, less than 25 cents to produce quarters and less than 50 cents to produce half dollars, when the Mint \u201csells\u201d these coins to the Federal Reserve at face value, the payment it receives constitutes a sizable \u201cprofit.\u201d This revenue, called seigniorage, is used to finance the national deficit; it reduces the amount of money the government would otherwise borrow, and the interest that would have been charged on that borrowed money. Pennies have \u201cnegative seigniorage,\u201d as do nickels, though we produce many fewer nickels. (The hierarchy between the two manifests inside coin-operated machines, many of which still accept nickels but nearly all of which, since the 1960s, have been engineered to automatically reject pennies.)  In 2023, creating dimes, quarters and half dollars generated more than $433 million in revenue. Minting pennies and nickels ate away about $179 million of that profit. Even undiminished, however, $433 million would have represented less than a fraction of 1 percent of the government\u2019s $6.13 trillion budget. At this scale, the question \u201cShould we make pennies?\u201d is, essentially, a personality quiz: Does the idea of losing money bother you enough that you feel compelled to stop it, even if the amount of money is trivial? Americans confront this question individually each time they receive pennies. Every penny deserted at checkout is a no. The government\u2019s approach is the same as its citizens\u2019. Sure, a person will eventually lose the price of a cup of coffee in left-behind pennies, and a nation will sacrifice enough money to install several hundred thousand reflective road signs that can be read at night. But if you can stomach the arrant waste, you are spared its contemplation. \u201cMy sense,\u201d said Jeff Gore, a professor of biophysics at M.I.T., \u201cis if something is easy to do and it makes the world better, then we should do it.\u201d Gore is the creator of what is now called Citizens to Retire the U.S. Penny, the inverse of Mark Weller\u2019s Americans for Common Cents. Gore jokingly refers to his undertaking as a \u201cgrass-roots organization\u201d; \u201cthe reality is it\u2019s a website,\u201d he said. He came up with it one night while killing time in his lab two decades ago. It hasn\u2019t needed much updating. \u201cThere are lots of problems in the world that are important and difficult,\u201d Gore said, \u201cbut this is just not one of them.\u201d To Gore, the dearest cost of penny production is not the money spent manufacturing and distributing the coins but that the cent \u201cdoes the opposite of what currency is supposed to do\u201d \u2014 facilitate transactions. \u201cPeople think that because it exists and is used, it means that it\u2019s useful,\u201d Gore said. He compared the Treasury Department\u2019s effect on the raw metals that compose a penny to a reverse Midas\u2019 touch: \u201cWe\u2019re taking something that is actually a valuable commodity,\u201d he said, \u201csomething that has actual value, and then we\u2019re converting it into something that people just throw away.\u201d Contemplating minor coins may be an arcane, practically pointless duty of the secretary of the Treasury of the United States, who is, based on the latest information available, Janet Yellen; nonetheless, as treasure-adjacent business, it is soundly, and legally, her purview. For months, via her staff, I begged Yellen for an interview. The secretary of the Treasury, I was informed, is \u201cone of the most accomplished economists of our time\u201d \u2014 a condition that evidently renders her unable to talk to me about pennies, even by phone, even for five minutes. She was busy; she was overseas. What was she doing there, I asked. She was meeting with green-business leaders in Germany. I wanted to ask Janet Yellen if the United States needs pennies, because I believe that she may be the only human being whose answer matters: While consulting Title 31 of the U.S. Code (to see how much annual penny minting was required by law), I came upon a statute outlining general instructions for the apportionment of American coins. \u201cThe Secretary of the Treasury shall,\u201d Section 5111 reads, \u201cmint and issue\u201d denominations of coins \u201cin amounts the Secretary decides are necessary to meet the needs of the United States.\u201d I reread the sentence several times. Groping for a light switch in a bolted room, had my fingers brushed over the knob of an unlocked door? Amounts the Secretary decides are necessary. What if the secretary decided the amount of pennies necessary was zero? I contacted Christine Desan, a Harvard law professor who specializes in the constitutional law of money. I asked what she made of Section 5111. \u201cThe way it reads to me as a lawyer,\u201d Desan said, is that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in here that indicates the secretary has to issue them.\u201d No one I interviewed had mentioned this statute. In fact, every news article, government report and congressional transcript I read \u2014 as well as every person I consulted, including former Mint directors \u2014 appeared to assume that penny production could not cease until Congress passed a law halting it. But if this interpretation was correct, no law was needed. Or rather, no new law: In passing the statute, a previous Congress \u2014 a very, very previous Congress, now confined to the realm of history \u2014 had already declared that pennies could stop any time a Treasury secretary wished them to. Does Yellen earnestly believe it necessary for the United States to issue billions more pennies every year? Her spokesman provided a general statement about coins, asserting that the Federal Reserve is in charge of determining the country\u2019s coin needs. I asked if Yellen knew of any legal reasons Section 5111 could not be carried out as written; if she considers any factors other than the Federal Reserve\u2019s coin orders when deciding what denominations are \u201cnecessary\u201d in the United States; if she could comment on the Treasury Department\u2019s own conclusion that hardly any of the billions of cents minted in the United States are spent by anyone \u2014 that they mostly just disappear, which is why the Federal Reserve needs constantly to order more, destined for the same fate. Days later, her spokesman replied: The Treasury relies on the Federal Reserve to determine the amount of coins needed; I should contact the Federal Reserve if I had any more questions. When I approached the Federal Reserve, a representative informed me that \u201cany questions on coin\u201d should, in fact, be directed to the Mint. The Mint, in turn, advised me to seek answers from the Federal Reserve. In May, I took a trip to Washington to visit Abraham Lincoln relics: the palm-size glass negative from Mathew Brady\u2019s studio, on which his penny portrait is based; the Georgia marble colossus at whose feet \u2014 in memoriam, apparently \u2014 visitors deposit trash in the form of 1-cent coins. Our murdered president is a primary character in our nation\u2019s story of endless penny production. If America\u2019s deference to the penny can be imagined as a single vine, its curlicues knotted together in such density as to blot out all light of logic, the bullet that ripped through Lincoln\u2019s skull is its seed. \u201cYou find out fast how much people care about coins the moment you start talking about removing\u201d Lincoln, Philip Diehl told me. \u201cAll of a sudden, there are a lot of people who care about coins.\u201d Lincoln never expected his legacy would include being pictured on pennies until the end of time. At no point in his life had any president appeared on coins. It was American law, and tradition, that coins should not portray them. Congress decided this in 1792, when it created the Mint; putting rulers on coins was un-American \u2014 behavior that would \u201cgratify our enemies.\u201d U.S. coins obeyed this edict for more than a century, depicting, instead, abstract symbols \u201cemblematic of liberty,\u201d helpfully labeled \u201cLIBERTY\u201d (this is why it says \u201cLIBERTY\u201d behind Lincoln\u2019s neck; legally, he can only appear on the coins if he is emblematic of liberty) until Theodore Roosevelt took office. Roosevelt had a habit of unilaterally replacing American coins he considered ugly \u2014 \u201cartistically of atrocious hideousness,\u201d to use his words \u2014 with designs he liked more. He installed Lincoln on the cent because he felt like it. He doesn\u2019t appear to have run the idea by anyone. Secreted behind a series of security doors inside the National Museum of American History is a vault of charcoal filing cabinets. The cabinets are nearly as tall as their custodian, Ellen Feingold, the curator of the Smithsonian National Numismatic Collection, under whose supervision the drawers can be unlocked to reveal hundreds of stacked shelves, each no wider than a penny\u2019s height. The shelves pull out like oven trays, bearing honeycombs of miniature storage boxes. Inside this climate-controlled ventricle, the shelves and boxes preserve the money history of the human race over the last 3,000 years. Monetary design, in Feingold\u2019s telling, reveals more about a nation\u2019s values than its monuments. \u201cYou could put a statue up, but the statue is in one place,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people will never go there.\u201d Currency is unique: an everyday object, saturated with symbolism, of tremendous practical importance, that can find its way to every American, regardless of demographic. Because American money is intended for use by Americans, it\u2019s natural that the way money functions in their real lives \u2014 the ways in which they actually do use it, not merely the ways in which it can, theoretically, be used \u2014 should dictate its configuration. It is, in fact, tradition to modify our currency based on majority preference. Recall how the persistent popularity of Spanish pieces of eight destroyed Thomas Jefferson\u2019s decimalized dreams \u2014 dreams that, if strictly realized, would have denied today\u2019s Americans their most-used coin, the (indivisible-by-10) quarter. A permanent deference in our national currency design to the tastes and practicalities of a particular year \u2014 to that year\u2019s president; to Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s preferred pennies \u2014 \u201cto me is ahistorical,\u201d said Feingold, fresh off examining a pinky-nail-size ancient coin with gloved fingers. (Recall that when Roosevelt installed Lincoln on the cent, the coin was worth more than a quarter in today\u2019s money.) This fact is inescapable in the coin vault, with its racks of wartime stamp currency and flimsy Depression-era tokens and centuries-old chits of paper insistently labeled \u201c12 shillings.\u201d American money \u2014 like, it is easy to forget, all facets of public life \u2014 can be anything Americans need or want it to be. It must not be a certain way simply because it has long been so. It does not have to be pennies.

Reporting from Bayonne, N.J., and New York For the first time in nearly 50 years, longshoremen on the East and Gulf Coasts went on strike Tuesday, a move that will cut off most trade through some of the busiest U.S. ports and could send a chill through the economy. Members of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association union, or I.L.A., which represents roughly 45,000 workers, started setting up pickets after talks failed to avert a work stoppage. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to move without us \u2014 nothing,\u201d Harold J. Daggett, the president of the union, told picketers outside a port terminal in Elizabeth, N.J., on Tuesday. But in a sign that the union and the group representing port employers might be getting closer to a deal, Mr. Daggett told CNBC on Tuesday morning that the union was now seeking raises that added up to 61.5 percent over a six-year contract, down from the 77 percent the union had asked for earlier in negotiations. The United States Maritime Alliance, the employers\u2019 group, said on Tuesday that its latest offer had included raises of \u201cnearly 50 percent\u201d and that it looked forward \u201cto hearing from the union about how we can return to the table and actually bargain.\u201d In addition to wage increases, the use of new technology in the ports has been a sticking point for the union.

Supported by Photographs and Video by Sasha Arutyunova Nancy Martiny didn\u2019t know what she was doing when she made her first saddle. It took her almost a year of stolen afternoons \u2014 between ranching, rodeoing and raising three children in rural Idaho \u2014 to complete it. But because she did it under the guidance of a renowned saddlemaker, Dale Harwood, that first saddle turned out well. And because she was a real-life cowgirl who rode in that saddle while producing rodeos and working cattle, people trusted her \u2014 even though she was a woman in a field dominated by men. \u201cI was out amongst my customers,\u201d Martiny said. \u201cAnd that gives a man the confidence that I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d The orders started rolling in. And for more than three decades, they haven\u2019t stopped. Martiny, 65, wears pearl-snap shirts tucked into bluejeans, and speaks deliberately, with dashes of dry humor. She lives with her rancher husband in a log cabin in May, Idaho, in a seemingly endless valley surrounded by bulky green mountains that resemble sleeping dinosaurs. It was here, in her home workshop, that Martiny recently made her 500th saddle. The wait time for a new \u201cNancy saddle\u201d is now around six years, despite the fact that she closed her order book in 2022.

That\u2019s what happened to me just the other morning,\u201d she wrote in a 1998 essay. \u201cI realized that, according to the racial zodiac, 2000 is the official Year of the Mulatto. Pure breeds (at least Black ones) are out; hybridity is in. America loves us in all of our half-caste glory.\u201d Droll, insouciant, provocative? Of course \u2014 Danzy Senna wrote it.

Her debut novel, \u201cCaucasia,\u201d also published in 1998, followed two biracial sisters born in 1970s Boston who are separated by their parents and whose lives take very different paths.

Her latest book, \u201cColored Television,\u201d her sixth, satirizes Hollywood, academia, the publishing industry, the housing market, ambition and, not least, the pervasive trope of the tragic mulatto.

Tens of thousands of women who are not pregnant are ordering abortion pills just in case they might need them someday, especially in states where access is threatened, according to a study published on Tuesday. The practice, known as advance provision, is relatively new and has increased significantly since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2022 to overturn the national right to abortion. In the study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers evaluated data from Aid Access, a telehealth organization that has long provided abortion pills to women in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy and began offering the medication to women in the United States who weren\u2019t pregnant in September 2021. Before May 2022, when a draft of the Supreme Court decision was leaked, Aid Access had received about 6,000 advance provision requests, averaging 25 per day. Since then, it has received over 42,000 requests, averaging 118 per day, said Dr. Abigail Aiken, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin and a co-author of the study. The biggest spikes in demand followed events that raised doubts about the future availability of abortion. Requests peaked in the weeks between the leak and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June 2022, and in April 2023 after a flurry of court rulings in a lawsuit by abortion opponents seeking to curtail mifepristone, a key abortion pill, a case now before the Supreme Court. Rates of requests were highest in states where abortion bans were expected \u2014 even higher than in states that already had bans. Asked why they requested the pills, most women said to \u201censure personal health and choice\u201d and \u201cprepare for possible abortion restrictions,\u201d according to the study. \u201cPeople were obviously paying attention and seeing the threat of abortion access either going away or being reduced where they were and thinking, \u2018I need to get prepared for that,\u2019\u201d Dr. Aiken said.

  "2025-04-26_373541_1": "Supported by Track and field\u2019s antidoping arm, the Athletics Integrity Unit, has announced a string of cases in recent months. Is that the sign of a problem, or proof that its approach is working? Reporting from Monaco The announcements of track and field\u2019s latest doping case or multiyear suspension arrived on an almost weekly basis this spring. A world champion. An Olympic medalist. And, most recently, three record-holders in a month. The most immediate consequence, according to the official charged with pursuing doping violations in the sport, has been to create the impression that track has a serious doping problem, one perhaps much bigger than that of other sports in the Paris Olympics. The reality, he said, is that catching athletes who break the rules is the point. \u201cI would be much more concerned to be a fan of other sports that don\u2019t have any doping cases,\u201d said Brett Clothier, the Australian lawyer who leads the Athletics Integrity Unit, the body charged with catching track\u2019s doping cheats. \u201cHaving no cases doesn\u2019t mean no doping.\u201d To Mr. Clothier, then, a string of investigations and suspensions in a sport with a well-documented doping history is not a cause for concern but rather an inherent contradiction: To restore his sport\u2019s reputation, he and his colleagues must first in the eyes of some besmirch it even more. As a case involving positive tests for Chinese swimmers hangs over the Olympic pool, Mr. Clothier also has joined elite athletes and government investigators in publicly questioning whether the current global antidoping system can ever fully eradicate drug cheats. Each sport is left to arrange its own antidoping procedures. Still, each new violation uncovered in track and field is, to him, proof that the sport is doing what many others are not: unapologetically pursuing elite athletes who might be taking banned substances, and providing a fairer platform for everyone. \u201cOur track record, first and foremost, indicates we have the means and commitment to actually uncover doping,\u201d Mr. Clothier said in an interview in June. \u201cIf I was a fan of other sports, I would worry that not enough is happening. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Most sports don\u2019t do enough to uncover doping.\u201d Track and field\u2019s commitment to tackling doping was born out of scandal, and a golden plaque attached to a wall near the entrance of the unit\u2019s offices in Monaco serves as a daily reminder of those dark times. There, engraved in gold, is the name of Lamine Diack, the former president of track and field\u2019s governing body. A Senegalese administrator who was for decades one of the most influential figures in sports, Mr. Diack and several other top track officials were accused of soliciting bribes from athletes who had been caught doping in exchange for covering up their positive results and allowing them to continue competing, including at the Olympics. Mr. Diack was convicted by a French court in 2020; he died a year later. The scandal was so profound, and so damaging to track and field\u2019s brand, that the sport\u2019s leaders eventually changed the organization\u2019s name and logo as they tried to distance it from the past. Those changes also led to the creation of the Athletics Integrity Unit, known as the A.I.U., and to a commitment to devote a higher percentage of the budget \u2014 about 12 percent annually, or roughly $12 million \u2014 of the rebranded governing body, World Athletics, to rooting out doping. The level of independence enjoyed by the A.I.U. is rare in elite sports. While its offices sit two floors below those of track and field\u2019s headquarters in a salmon-colored building in Monte Carlo, Mr. Clothier answers not to the current leader of World Athletics, Sebastian Coe, but to a separate board. That arrangement ensures that track\u2019s current leaders hold little power over the antidoping body\u2019s activities. That structure has enabled Mr. Clothier and his second in command, Thomas Capdevielle, to build a rigorous and intelligence-driven testing system that the A.I.U. uses to locate and test athletes wherever they are in the world, sometimes at a moment\u2019s notice. The strategy starts at the top. A group of the top 10 athletes per discipline in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s categories is selected to be part of the World Athletics testing pool. Each athlete has a profile and a bespoke risk score from 1 to 10, calculated from a range of factors, including the athlete\u2019s testing history, performances, nationality \u2014 there are athletes from 90 nations in the testing pool \u2014 and intelligence reports from testers in the field. The higher the score, the higher the risk. A rank of red out of four color-coded categories signifies that, according to A.I.U. data, an athlete has a higher likelihood of doping. Those athletes are tested more often and placed under greater scrutiny. But suspecting, or even being convinced, that an athlete is cheating is very different from catching a cheater. Long gone are the days, Mr. Clothier said, of huge amounts of banned substances lingering in the bloodstream. The window to catch athletes has now shrunk so much, he said, that the so-called washout period for some banned substances \u2014 the time when it disappears from an athlete\u2019s system \u2014 is sometimes a few hours. Greater sophistication among cheats and their entourages in microdosing, or taking tiny amounts of prohibited substances at regular intervals, during training periods can make catching them even more difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s really become a game of cat and mouse,\u201d Mr. Clothier said. That is why the A.I.U. expends so much effort on preparation, intelligence and targeted out-of-competition testing, he said, rather than the blanket testing of athletes at regular intervals, as many other sports still do, or only at major events. That rigorous approach can be exacting for track\u2019s athletes. They have to update their whereabouts every day of the year while they are in the testing pool, and they provide a daily one-hour window when they are available to be tested. Even then, if a tester can track them down outside that time, they are obliged to provide samples. Failure to be present or to provide a sample results in a \u201cwhereabouts failure.\u201d Three of those in a calendar year result in a two-year suspension as part of strict rules in place to prevent evasion. To catch the right athlete at the right time for the right substances, whereabouts \u201cis key,\u201d Mr. Clothier said. Still, two years is less than a possible longer exile if they are caught doping. That fact, he said, can lead athletes to make calculations about whether to answer a surprise knock on the door from an A.I.U. sample collector. That was the conundrum the Nigerian sprinter and long jumper Blessing Okagbare faced when testers arrived at her home in Florida shortly before the last Olympics. Investigators had found text exchanges between Okagbare and Eric Lira, a Texas therapist, in which Okagbare appeared to tell Mr. Lira that she did not reply to a visit from testers because she was not sure it was \u201csafe\u201d to take a test. Okagbare was eventually tracked down in Europe and gave a sample. When that came back positive for growth hormones, she was pulled from her events at the Tokyo Olympics and suspended. But her case was a vivid example of how even intelligence and strict rules aren\u2019t foolproof: Okagbare already had two whereabouts failures when she finally submitted a test. \u201cIf she was on one,\u201d Mr. Clothier said of the failures, \u201cthen she probably doesn\u2019t answer the door.\u201d Okagbare received a 10-year ban from competition and Mr. Lira a prison sentence for supplying her with the drugs. In an Olympic year, antidoping veterans know, cheating rises. \u201cThis is a real, red-hot, crucial moment,\u201d Mr. Capdevielle, the head of testing, said of the period before the Paris Olympics. The A.I.U. data proves it: The number of athletes in the red zone changes when they make frequent changes to their travel itineraries, which investigators said could be a sign of something nefarious. To counter that, the agency constantly fine-tunes its matrix to ensure that the right athlete is tested at the right time and for the right substances. In its constant search for reliable testing partners, the A.I.U. favors the use of private companies over national antidoping bodies, which Mr. Clothier said could be slow to act and less interested in seeing their own athletes punished. The A.I.U. has cited a run of recent cases \u2014 a sprinter from Suriname, a pole-vaulter from Brazil, a Kenyan distance runner \u2014 as proof that its targeted approach was succeeding. But Mr. Clothier admitted that could be an illusion: He knows that athletes in track and field, and other sports, are still cheating and getting away with it. That may be why he is unflinching in his criticism of the current global antidoping system. \u201cI don\u2019t think,\u201d he said, \u201cthat it\u2019s working particularly well.\u201d An earlier version of this article and two picture captions with it misstated the surname of an Athletics Integrity Unit official. He is Thomas Capdevielle, not Capedeveille. The article also misstated the surname of a Nigerian sprinter and long jumper. She is Blessing Okagbare, not Okabare.

  "2025-04-26_809323_1": "Supported by No club has won European soccer\u2019s richest prize more than Real Madrid, but its recent dominance has been accompanied by a bruising fight over the tournament\u2019s future. Reporting from London Real Madrid had the celebratory jerseys ready as soon as its place in the Champions League final was secured. As the players raced to one another, exulting in yet another heart-stopping, nerve-shredding win, staff members sprinted onto the field after them, ensuring each star was correctly attired. On the back of each shirt was the latest club-approved slogan: A Por La 15. For the 15th. The shorthand ran the risk of coming across as hubris: Real Madrid\u2019s 15th Champions League title was still one win away. Nobody, though, seemed especially worried. The Champions League, as far as the team that has won it twice as often as anyone else is concerned, very much belongs to Real Madrid. That belief has put the Spanish club at the center of a power struggle whose stakes include nothing less than control over the future of European soccer. It\u2019s a bitter fight between wealthy clubs and powerful administrators over who matters most, who should set the agenda and \u2014 perhaps most important \u2014 who should benefit from the billions of dollars of broadcast and sponsorship revenue the continent\u2019s richest competitions generate every year. The clash features two of the most powerful figures in world soccer: Real Madrid\u2019s unabashed president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, representing European soccer\u2019s old guard, against the leader of the continent\u2019s governing body, Aleksander Ceferin, who has wielded influence and threats to maintain his own version of the status quo. And it has placed UEFA \u2014 European soccer\u2019s governing body, and the organization that actually runs the competition \u2014 in an increasingly awkward position of regularly celebrating a club that represents a serious threat to its authority. Victory against Germany\u2019s Borussia Dortmund on Saturday would mean Real Madrid has been crowned champion of UEFA\u2019s marquee competition six times in the last decade. At the same time, it is entering the third year of a bitter legal struggle, conducted largely through proxies, designed if not to destroy the Champions League then certainly to bring about the most sweeping changes in its history.

  "2025-04-26_532220_1": "Congestion Pricing\u00a0in N.Y.C. Supported by In conversations, New York legislators have suggested a way to bring back the program, possibly with a toll below $15. Weeks after Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly pulled the plug on New York City\u2019s congestion pricing program, state lawmakers have privately begun an informal campaign to persuade her to move ahead with the tolls, but make them less expensive. In a series of recent conversations, the legislators suggested to Ms. Hochul that she could bring back a modified form of the initiative, which would have been the nation\u2019s first central business district tolling program. If the governor agreed to reduce the yearly amount of money that the law requires to be collected from the tolls, she would have some cushion to alter the program \u2014 potentially lowering the proposed $15 charge to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. \u201cI\u2019ve personally urged the governor to mend it, not end it,\u201d said Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a state senator representing a Manhattan district much of which is within the proposed congestion zone. \u201cI think there could be an appetite among my colleagues to adjust the toll and other features of congestion pricing while approving additional revenue to make up the shortfall to the M.T.A., but only if the program is allowed to proceed.\u201d The ambitious but contentious program had the twin goals of generating billions of dollars for the region\u2019s transit system and cutting congestion in Manhattan. But on June 5, less than four weeks before it was to go into effect, Ms. Hochul indefinitely paused it, seeming to consign the plan to New York\u2019s trash heap of ambitious, abandoned projects.

Acadia Healthcare is holding people against their will to maximize insurance payouts, a Times investigation found. Acadia Healthcare\u2019s Park Royal hospital in Florida is among those that wrongly held some patients against their will.Credit...Michael Adno for The New York Times Supported by Acadia Healthcare is one of America\u2019s largest chains of psychiatric hospitals. Since the pandemic exacerbated a national mental health crisis, the company\u2019s revenue has soared. Its stock price has more than doubled. But a New York Times investigation found that some of that success was built on a disturbing practice: Acadia has lured patients into its facilities and held them against their will, even when detaining them was not medically necessary. In at least 12 of the 19 states where Acadia operates psychiatric hospitals, dozens of patients, employees and police officers have alerted the authorities that the company was detaining people in ways that violated the law, according to records reviewed by The Times. In some cases, judges have intervened to force Acadia to release patients. Some patients arrived at emergency rooms seeking routine mental health care, only to find themselves sent to Acadia facilities and locked in. A social worker spent six days inside an Acadia hospital in Florida after she tried to get her bipolar medications adjusted. A woman who works at a children\u2019s hospital was held for seven days after she showed up at an Acadia facility in Indiana looking for therapy. And after police officers raided an Acadia hospital in Georgia, 16 patients told investigators that they had been kept there \u201cwith no excuses or valid reason,\u201d according to a police report. Acadia held all of them under laws meant for people who pose an imminent threat to themselves or others. But none of the patients appeared to have met that legal standard, according to records and interviews. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

A meaningful armistice that secures Ukraine\u2019s well-earned sovereignty will be achieved only if Ukraine deals the invading forces a series of decisive blows that impress upon them the futility of continuing their misguided war. The Ukrainian people, their political leadership and their armed forces have demonstrated truly impressive resolve. When the U.S. Congress returns this month, Democrats and Republicans must overcome their differences, act with renewed resolve and approve their now-delayed arms package for Ukraine. This is the language that Mr. Putin will understand. It will prove to be the only road to a lasting peace. Geoffrey BerlinKyiv, Ukraine To the Editor: It is undeniable that the war in Ukraine has devolved into a stalemate. But the solution should not be to attempt a long-term armistice, as Serge Schmemann argues. Doing so might mean less bloodshed and hardship for Ukrainians in the short term, but any agreement that cedes Ukrainian territory to Russia woefully misreads the geopolitical climate.

  "2025-04-26_509310_1": "Supported by Guest Essay Mr. Coates is a columnist for Algemeen Dagblad, a Dutch daily newspaper, and the author of \u201cWhy the Dutch Are Different.\u201d He wrote from the Netherlands. Joseph Luns, who served as secretary general of NATO from 1971 to 1984, was not a typical diplomat. When he took charge of the military alliance after nearly 20 years as the foreign minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Luns surprised his new colleagues by leaving the office at 1 p.m. on Fridays and reportedly wearing bright red slippers at important summits because they were \u201cmore comfortable than shoes.\u201d Asked once how many people worked at NATO, Mr. Luns is said to have replied: \u201cAbout 50 percent.\u201d Mr. Luns was known for being ebullient but prickly, with little patience for anyone whose support of the alliance was anything less than unwavering. This blend of authority and joviality served him well, helping NATO navigate the storm of protest around the Vietnam War, Ronald Reagan\u2019s standoffs with the Soviet Union and the diplomatic fallout of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Despite his unconventional ways, Mr. Luns was the longest serving secretary general NATO has ever had, racking up about 13 years in the role. On Tuesday, another straight-talking, long-serving Dutch statesman will take the helm at NATO. Like Mr. Luns, Mark Rutte will take office after a long apprenticeship on the international stage: He recently ended an extraordinary 14-year run as prime minister of the Netherlands. Mr. Rutte takes office at a turbulent time, with NATO allies fighting a proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, the Middle East in turmoil and the alliance wracked by difficult questions about how it should expand in the future. A rising tide of far-right populism in countries including France, Germany and the Netherlands itself also threatens to upend decades of solidarity between allies. This would be an intimidating to-do list for any new secretary general, but also may mean that it\u2019s the perfect moment for NATO \u2014 for the fourth time \u2014 to again be led by a plain-spoken Dutchman. In some countries, the job of a president or prime minister is a visionary one, requiring bold leadership and soaring rhetoric. Here in the Netherlands, however, coalition governments are the norm and the role of a Dutch premier is more like that of a small-town salesman: constantly chasing doubters, negotiating compromises and persuading people to make deals they don\u2019t want to make. As prime minister, Mr. Rutte pivoted from governing with the support of the far right to governing in coalition with the center left. (\u201cI usually compromise,\u201d he said in 2018. \u201cI mix water with the wine.\u201d) As the war in Ukraine rumbles through its third year, members within the alliance are split between those determined to repel Russian aggression \u2014 see Britain, France and Poland \u2014 and those who have opposed sending aid to Ukraine \u2014 see Viktor Orban of Hungary. Mr. Rutte himself has been a staunch ally of Ukraine, describing Vladimir Putin as \u201ccoldhearted, brutal, merciless,\u201d and telling the U.N. in 2022: \u201cThis war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It\u2019s about upholding the international rule of law.\u201d But Mr. Rutte is also a political chameleon, capable of being almost all things to almost all people. In The Hague, Mr. Rutte is known as an unassuming figure who generally eschews bodyguards, lives in a modest house and often gets around by bicycle. He is hawkish but socially liberal. After more than a decade of running the Netherlands, he is as comfortable in grand summit rooms and senates as he presumably was in a school in The Hague where, until recently, he still taught a weekly social studies class.

Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine Russian forces struck several of Ukraine\u2019s energy facilities with drones and missiles early Saturday, in a major air assault that targeted cities across the country, including some near the borders with NATO members. The Ukrainian Air Force said that Russia had fired 53 missiles at its territory, that it had shot down two-thirds, and that some had been heading toward the western Zakarpattia and Lviv regions, which border Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, countries that are part of NATO. The Polish Army said its fighter jets and those of other allies had been scrambled to protect their borders in case a Russian weapon crossed them, as has happened in the past. The strike on Saturday was Russia\u2019s sixth attack on energy facilities in Ukraine since March, part of a wider campaign seemingly aimed at cutting off power to swaths of the country and making life miserable for civilians. The barrage of missiles, which a top Ukrainian official said had injured about 20 people and which targeted a part of the country that has been less affected by the war, could add urgency to Kyiv\u2019s recent calls for help from allies to protect its vulnerable regions. The attack followed a week in which several NATO allies signaled approval for Ukraine\u2019s limited firing of Western weapons into Russia, culminating with the United States on Thursday. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine argued in an interview with The New York Times last month that if Ukraine\u2019s Western neighbors shot down Russian missiles coming close to their own borders \u2014 without having their planes cross into Ukrainian airspace \u2014 it would ease the burden on the Ukrainian Army, which is facing shortages of air defense ammunition and weapons. \u201cTechnically, all of this is possible,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cShooting down Russian missiles already in Ukrainian territory, from their planes.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Reporting from Aigues-Mortes, France; Maldon, England; and Portland, Ore. Knee-deep in the improbably pink marsh water of the Camargue, on the southern coast of France, I shoveled fleur de sel crystals onto the shore into shimmering mounds, the same way that the sauniers, traditional salt workers, toiling around me on a hot July morning have been doing in that region since Roman times. Eric Beaumer, a master saunier at Le Saunier de Camargue, sprinkled some of the warm, damp salt into my hand. I licked my palm and the shards crunched, then dissolved in a saline burst. It was the same mineral rush I had experienced earlier that day when I sprinkled fleur de sel on my eggs, and the one I would have again two hours later with a tomato salad. The brittle crystals made the eggs seem more custardy, the tomatoes more ripely sweet. That\u2019s the magic of flaky sea salt: It makes food taste more deeply of itself.

This is Street Wars, a weekly series on the battle for space on New York\u2019s streets and sidewalks. At first glance, the Queens neighborhood of Bayside certainly looks like an idyllic place to ride a bike. Far from the chaotic noise of Manhattan, under a wide-open sky, small, low-slung houses sit set back from the curb on shady side streets. Neatly clipped lawns burst with blue and pink hydrangeas. One house has a homespun \u201cWelcome\u201d sign with a strawberry in place of the \u201co.\u201d But in front of that house, just to the left of its perfectly trimmed hedges, stands a red sign with white letters: NO BIKE LANES. Across the street is another red sign, and then another. Up and down Oceania Street. Along 53rd Avenue. There are signs next to driveways. Next to parked cars. Across from the elementary school and the middle school. Near the church. At least two houses with statues of the Virgin Mary, arms open in a gesture of kindness and compassion, also have scolding red NO BIKE LANES signs. There are, in fact, bike lanes in Bayside, and in the adjacent neighborhood of Fresh Meadows, where more red signs can be found. And more bike lanes are coming to Queens. The new lanes, where the signs are, were installed last fall and encourage sharing the road in an area that is mostly a public transportation desert: Bayside has a Long Island Rail Road station, but you\u2019d have to walk an hour to get to the closest subway. The sign campaign is proof that every block in New York is a battleground, and city officials face a multitude of challenges as they try to accommodate all the ways streets are used, from neighborhood to neighborhood. In Queens, there are cyclists who clamored for the new bike lanes as a matter of safety. And there are residents who resent the lanes because they replaced parking spaces in front of their houses.

Experts say the industry may not survive there, even with the ingenuity of the country\u2019s water managers. Reporting from Gouda, the Netherlands On a recent morning in Gouda, a small city in the Netherlands, hundreds of wheels of yellow cheese lay out in rows on the cobblestones of the town square, a backdrop to the city\u2019s weekly cheese market, which dates to the Middle Ages. Ad van Kluijve, a farmer dressed in blue work shirt, red bandanna, blue cap and wooden clogs, haggled with a buyer over the price of his latest batch of \u201cjong belegen,\u201d famous for its mild caramel flavor. In the rest of the world, it is one of many cheeses named after the city in which it is traded. The haggling is largely a performance for tourists as the actual price negotiations take place elsewhere. The Gouda cheese industry is very real, though; roughly 60 percent of the cheese produced in the country is Gouda cheese, with an export value of $1.7 billion annually, according to ZuivelNL, which represents the Dutch dairy sector. But it\u2019s unlikely the cheese market will be here in 50 to 100 years because of a confluence of a few factors, experts say: The city, built on peat marsh, has always been vulnerable to sinking, and that risk is now greater because increased rainfall and rising sea levels \u2014 a consequence of climate change \u2014 threaten to flood the river delta in which it sits. \u201cWe\u2019re not in good shape,\u201d said Gilles Erkens, a professor at Utrecht University and the head of a team focused on land subsidence at Deltares, a nonprofit research institute. \u201cIt\u2019s a very worrisome situation.\u201d North Sea Amsterdam NETHERLANDS Gouda  GERMANY BELGIUM 40 MILES Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Topol: Graft permeates every level of the Russian Army, from the top brass to the grunts. Ivan watched as one of his commanders stole state-subsidized fuel from the military and sold it on the side at the civilian-market price. He was also ordering his subordinates to saw wood from the base\u2019s firing range so he could sell it. Few civilians realized that most of the military\u2019s commanders were fiscal hostages. When an officer assumed his position, he was responsible for all his unit\u2019s equipment, much of which had been sold or bartered by the previous commander and so was not actually there. This made it impossible to abdicate his job because it would look as though he stole the equipment, and he would have to use his own money to replace it. The equipment that was there was outdated and broke frequently \u2014 the parts were old and unserviceable or the repair unit just didn\u2019t feel like going out.

It might have been near bedtime in other countries, but Cairo was practically still waking up. That was summer in the past, season of sweat, and the city adapted its schedule. Days were for cooling inside, or at least avoiding the sun\u2019s blitzkrieg. Nighttime offered mercy. Though the concrete sidewalks still belched up the day\u2019s accumulated heat, the neighborhood came alive only after isha, the last of the five daily Muslim prayers. The day went on long into early morning. Not this summer. With an energy shortage prompting the government to mandate earlier closing times, 10 p.m. now brings a dimming to Sayyida Zeinab: metal shutters are down or rolling toward the ground, turning the loudly colored, exuberantly lit storefronts to gray. Years into an economic crunch that has left the government scrambling for dollars and made life a misery for all but the richest, Egypt is short on natural gas and funds to buy more, necessitating daily countrywide blackouts until a few weeks ago. So, starting in July, orders came from on high: To save electricity, stores must close by 10 p.m. and cafes, restaurants and malls by midnight, slightly later on weekends.

Curtis Bashaw maneuvers his lanky body through a maze of picnic tables, stopping every few steps to repeat his upbeat introductory pitch to voters waiting for lunch on a recent weekday. He is a Republican running to represent New Jersey in the U.S. Senate, he tells groups of graying attendees at Bergen County\u2019s annual senior festival. A fiscal conservative, he adds. A hotel owner from Cape May, N.J. A gay, married man. \u201cI don\u2019t think government should tell us what to do in our own homes,\u201d he says, bending down on one knee to be heard above music coming from a nearby stage. He has positioned himself as a moderate competing for a seat vacated in spectacular fashion by the state\u2019s longtime Democratic senator, Robert Menendez, who was convicted of peddling his political influence in exchange for cash, gold and a Mercedes-Benz. Mr. Bashaw, 64, beat a candidate endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump to win the Republican nomination, and his showing in November will be a measure of his party\u2019s appeal to centrist voters at a time of heightened polarization. New Jersey has teetered between political parties when selecting governors. But it has been 52 years since voters elected a Republican senator, and both Mr. Bashaw and his closest supporters acknowledge that his road to victory is narrow. \u201cI don\u2019t mind being stealth,\u201d he says. With the race for president at a fever pitch, turnout is expected to be robust, a factor that in New Jersey benefits Democrats, whose voters outnumber Republicans by 930,000. Mr. Bashaw has chipped in $1.8 million to his campaign, yet as of July 1 had $3 million less to spend than his Democratic opponent, Representative Andy Kim, who unveiled his first television ad last week and said he planned to be on the air through Election Day.

The assassination yesterday of Ismail Haniyeh, a top Hamas leader, in Tehran has left the entire Middle East on edge, bringing vows of revenge from Iran\u2019s leaders and threatening to derail fragile negotiations about a Gaza cease-fire. Both Iran and Hamas accused Israel of killing Haniyeh, which Israel has neither confirmed nor denied. Now, the focus is on whether a response from Iran and its proxies could lead to a regional war. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Haniyeh\u2019s assassination would prompt a \u201charsh punishment,\u201d and officials said he had issued an order for Iran to strike Israel directly. In recent years, Israel has carried out several high-profile assassinations in Iran, rattling the country\u2019s leaders.

  "2025-04-26_864773_1": "The authorities said they did not believe the shooting was related to previous threats against the justices who barred Donald J. Trump from the state\u2019s primary ballot. A man was arrested early Tuesday after breaching the Colorado Supreme Court building, holding a guard at gunpoint and opening fire inside, the local authorities said. No injuries were reported, although the judicial center suffered extensive damage. The incident, coming two weeks after the court voted to bar former President Donald J. Trump from Colorado\u2019s 2024 presidential primary ballot, comes as tensions have risen across the country over legal challenges to Mr. Trump\u2019s eligibility to run for president. Justices on the court have reportedly received death threats since the decision on Mr. Trump was handed down, but the authorities in Colorado said they did not believe the shooting on Tuesday was associated with those threats, which remain under investigation. The man who opened fire inside the Colorado judicial center, which houses the state\u2019s Supreme Court and other judicial agencies, had been involved in a car crash nearby and had reportedly pointed a handgun at the other driver, the State Patrol said in a news release. The gunman, identified by the Denver police as Brandon Olsen, 44, then shot out a window of the Judicial Center, entered the building and held one of the security guards at gunpoint, demanding the guard\u2019s keys. The guard was not armed. The suspect then went to the seventh floor and fired additional shots inside the building, and at some point started a fire in the stairwell, the authorities said. Denver police officers and Colorado state troopers surrounded the building. At 3 a.m., officials said, the suspect called 911 and surrendered. Mr. Olsen is being held for investigation of robbery, burglary and arson, the police said. The Denver district attorney\u2019s office will make a final determination on charges. Last week, Maine\u2019s secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, was the victim of a \u201cswatting\u201d call to her home, just one day after she barred Mr. Trump from the Maine\u2019s primary ballot because of his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Ms. Bellows\u2019s staff have also received \u201cnonstop threatening communications\u201d she said in a post on Facebook. \u201cWe should be able to agree to disagree on important issues without threats and violence,\u201d she added.

A commercial Chinese rocket accidentally launched during a ground test on Sunday, climbing into the air before crashing into a nearby mountain and exploding in flames, the private company that owns the rocket said. Because of a \u201cstructural failure,\u201d the Tianlong-3 rocket separated from its testing platform while its propulsion system was being tested and lifted off from its launchpad, the rocket\u2019s owner Space Pioneer said in a statement. The accident occurred at 3:43 p.m. local time on Sunday at a test facility in Gongyi city in central China\u2019s Henan Province, the statement said. After launching, the onboard computer automatically shut down, and the rocket fell into a hilly area about one mile from the test site, the statement said. No one was injured, the statement said, adding that the crash site was far from residential areas and the company had worked with local authorities before the test to evacuate nearby areas. Videos posted by Chinese news media and on social media appeared to show the rocket climbing before it loses power and plunges, exploding in a nearby hill. The Gongyi municipal government said in a social media statement that the rocket\u2019s crash started a fire, which had been put out by Sunday evening. The accident seems to have occurred during a static fire test, when the engines are ignited as if for takeoff but the rocket remains secured to the ground, said Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University who reviewed videos of the accident. It was a very routine test, he said, adding that although it is often done with the rocket horizontally, some companies, including SpaceX, have done the test vertically.

Reporting from Killington, Vt. As Mikaela Shiffrin plans the next phase of her record-setting career as a skier, she is looking, as she always has, to the example of another female megastar who has experienced kindred highs and lows and highs in her career: Taylor Swift. The American skier Shiffrin is the most successful, and precocious, Alpine racer in history, having smashed the mark for World Cup victories, by women and men, while still in her prime skiing years. The American singer-songwriter Swift is the world\u2019s biggest pop star, smashing music industry records one after another. When Shiffrin made her debut on the World Cup circuit, she was just shy of turning 16, the same age Swift was when she began recording her debut album five years earlier. They have both been teenage sensations lavished with praise and profit. While Swift, named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year for 2023, might right now be the most famous human on the planet, Shiffrin, celebrated at home, has bona fide rock star status in Europe, where ski racing is the national sport of several countries. They are both at the top of their respective mountains. They have been innovators, history-makers and leading figures in their high-wire professions. But like many caught in the pop culture maelstrom, they\u2019ve experienced intense, barbed criticism after any failure, real or perceived. Each has openly dealt with a parent\u2019s death or serious illness and each has taken lengthy breaks from performing.

  "2025-04-26_822738_1": "Why have many Democrats embraced Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee, despite not knowing much about what she believes? We spoke to 14 Democrats as part of our latest Times Opinion focus group, and the answer was clear: Most had been deeply anxious about President Biden, and once he bowed out of the race, they needed a nominee fast. And it turned out, to the surprise of some, they liked her more than expected.   And yet: Many still aren\u2019t sure what she would do in the top job. Some of the more liberal or younger participants in the group wondered if Harris is too harsh on criminal justice or on migrants crossing the border. Others don\u2019t know what she would do about the economy \u2014 a top concern of theirs \u2014 or much else about her.   For all that, most of our 14 participants felt more hopeful about Harris than Biden, whose age and inarticulateness left some thinking they would not vote this year. Much of the excitement was about her personality, style and seriousness; two Black women in the group described her, approvingly, as \u201cstern.\u201d Jokes and memes in their group chats have reinforced the new energy around Harris; one man noted that his friends called her \u201cMother.\u201d  We were struck that Harris\u2019s status as potentially the first female president was a motivating factor to nearly everyone in the group, while her status as a Black and South Asian person was less motivating (including with people of color in the group). And is the country ready to elect a woman as president? They had strong views on that, too.  What worries you most about America today? The upcoming election. Division. Women\u2019s health and reproductive rights. Wealth gap. Inflation. Education. Crime. Affordable health care. Police brutality. Tyler L., tell us why you said America\u2019s best days are ahead of us. All of the bad in our history. I can\u2019t think of any period spanning longer than two or three years where things were peaceful or nice to all. I kind of agree. My age group gets to enjoy all of the fruits of protesting and changes in laws. I never experienced any of the things they had to experience. If you look at everything, we have gotten better \u2014 our freedoms, the crime rate. Jayden, you said our best days are behind us. For people my age, a lot of us feel our future is pretty bleak. The ability to get a job, how much we pay to go to school, how difficult it is to even just find a place to live because we can\u2019t work. It\u2019s just this never-ending cycle of constant stress, always worried. I think things were simpler years ago. You didn\u2019t have all the technology. People need to get back to the basics. What basics? Simple things, not complicated technology and stuff. I think we are into too much of this technology. And inflation has gotten awful. I\u2019m growing a future right now in my body. And I\u2019ve been in the health care field, so I see the changes. I worry about my child\u2019s education or health, and all inflation \u2014 it puts a worry on moms like me, on families like me. It\u2019s hard for me to look at a future where my unborn is going to be gifted or can make these things without me pushing and pushing and fighting for her future. I feel like the best is behind us. We\u2019re experiencing inflation. We\u2019re experiencing rent hikes. Eventually, Kameshia\u2019s going to need to pay for baby formula. Police brutality \u2014 I mean, my God, that\u2019s extremely personal. I want to ask about Joe Biden. Tell me how you were feeling about him as the Democratic nominee before the presidential debate in June. I voted for Biden. I\u2019ve always liked him and Barack Obama. People blame everything on the president, but Congress is the one who runs the show. Still, decisions that were made in the White House, like all these immigrants coming in and the expenses that the states are going through right now, it bothered me. Right here in the Bronx, we have so many hotels that I used to visit. And now they\u2019re all just completely full of immigrants that are living there. So there\u2019s nowhere for us to go, you know, whenever we want to just get away from it all. I was honestly undecided as to whether I was going to vote this year. Biden, I did like when he was with Obama. But a lot of people within my age group didn\u2019t feel so confident in his ability to execute what he said he was going to do. I do commend him for relieving some people of their student loans. He always just seemed so uncertain and so unsure when he would speak. His inability to articulate has always stood out, especially given his age. I was still on the positive side of voting for him. I voted for Biden. It worried me that he would not be able to complete a term, whether it is health reasons or just mental reasons where he can\u2019t function. So I was disappointed that he withdrew. I watched the debate. I was very disappointed. Biden just seemed so frail. I wish he quit the race earlier so we had more options to choose from on the Democratic side, not just one person. When you first heard the news that Biden was dropping out of the race, how did you feel? Surprised. Reassured. I genuinely thought, \u201cThank God.\u201d I was shocked. Hopeful. Excited. He was courageous. Elated. Relief. Later than it should have been. It\u2019s not great. Mark, why relief? Because I thought, \u201cThen we have a much stronger shot now.\u201d I thought a lot of people wouldn\u2019t vote. Being at a very liberal, very opinionated college \u2014 so many people have been saying they weren\u2019t going to vote. Nobody wanted to vote for any of the people running. And Michael, you said \u201cnot great.\u201d It\u2019s way too late for this. Having someone drop out six months before the election is not a good sign at all. I felt like Biden had a stronger chance against Trump. And then if he was unable to proceed, then Kamala Harris would be the next person in line. We wouldn\u2019t have to worry about her campaigning. I think it\u2019s a good thing he dropped out, because there\u2019s a stronger likelihood that Democrats will vote. People like being change makers. They like the idea, I think, of being a person who can say, \u201cI voted for the first woman president, the first woman of color president.\u201d How do you think Biden and his presidency will be remembered by history? I think that people will remember that he wasn\u2019t composed, that he wasn\u2019t articulate and that he just wasn\u2019t well put together compared to the other presidents. He helped heal us from the previous four years. He\u2019ll be remembered for helping with student loans. But his incompetence will also be remembered. I\u2019m sure hoping people will remember him being a good president in the beginning. And he tried to do so many things with global warming. He\u2019s going to make history for stepping down. I think they\u2019re going to remember that. So I\u2019m hoping they remember the good. When President Biden announced that he wasn\u2019t going to be running, what did you think might happen next? Well, I knew that Kamala was going to be put forth as the candidate. There were other candidates, but I didn\u2019t think it would be anybody else. And we have another candidate that\u2019s running, and they\u2019re not giving him any chance whatsoever, which is Robert Kennedy. And I think that\u2019s a little unfair. It makes sense that she would get the nomination. I actually thought Michelle Obama might run. Along those lines, were there candidates you were hoping would run, either Vice President Harris or other Democrats? No. I also agree with Steve that I think it was planned on. I think that Biden knew that this was his term and his opportunity to build his legacy. He took that opportunity, and he selected his V.P. knowing the responsibility of a V.P., knowing his age, knowing his challenges. And here we are. I really love Elizabeth Warren. And Pete Buttigieg as well, although I think he\u2019s pretty much set to be the V.P. My hand is kind of there, but I think, given the time, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other choice. How would you describe Vice President Harris in one word? Meh. Hopeful. Enthusiastic. I would say \u201cstrong.\u201d Indian American. \u201cCompetent,\u201d hopefully. \u201cComposed\u201d or \u201carticulate.\u201d Yeah, I would say \u201ccompetent\u201d as well. Stern. A real go-getter. Articulate. Aware. I would say \u201cstern\u201d as well. Someone who wants to be on the right side of history. Shantae and Kameshia, you both said \u201cstern.\u201d Why? She just comes across as very serious. And I can tell that she has experience and has worked in the legal department. I can definitely tell. I get that vibe and that energy from her. Do you mean \u201cstern\u201d as a positive? I think people expect women to be more warm. But because of the role that she is interviewing or trying to go for, it makes sense why she is stern, but also just because of her experience. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing. She\u2019s tough. She looks tough. And then she\u2019s tough on crimes. You expect women to be just easygoing, mothering, nurturing, all this good stuff. But no, she\u2019s strong and tough and fierce. Jayden, you said \u201ccomposed.\u201d It just seems like she isn\u2019t going to get into the drama of what has been. She seems like she is going to narrow it back to the topic and not get into a bickering match, if that makes sense. Michael, you said \u201cmeh.\u201d Unpack \u201cmeh\u201d for us. I mean, I think she\u2019s the best pick right now. I\u2019m still not 100 percent that I\u2019m going to vote for her over the other guy. But personally, I am not a fan at all of when she was attorney general of California and her history of prosecuting petty marijuana crimes and the whole Kevin Cooper case. Tyler L., you said \u201caware.\u201d I think she\u2019s just more in touch with social issues than two 70-year-old men that have come up rather wealthily. I think that she\u2019s just got a better finger on the pulse of what\u2019s actually happening with the general population. If Kamala Harris were a car, what kind of car would she be? Probably a Volkswagen Beetle. She\u2019s pretty compact in her manner. She doesn\u2019t waste words. And she seems like she could go a lot of miles, I think. I\u2019d say a Firebird. I think she\u2019s a go-getter. I\u2019m going to say an Escalade. Because she is very glamorous, she\u2019s intelligent and she\u2019s well spoken. And she\u2019s got a lot going for her. I would say a Honda with a modified muffler. Tell me why. She\u2019s very strong legally. I\u2019ve seen her in the Senate hearings, the way she was grilling. I wish she did the same in the primaries in 2020. I\u2019m glad she was a V.P. I hope she is articulate in the same way politically. Whatever car people might think of fast and slick, that\u2019s the only thing I could think of. OK, do you mean that as a positive? Yeah, definitely. I think she\u2019d be a Porsche. Because she needs to go from zero to president fast. And she knows that she can rely on style to get there. What\u2019s the \u201cbuilt tough\u201d truck? Is it a Ford or Dodge? I like that one. Can I change mine to \u201cbuilt Ford tough\u201d? I\u2019m not a car person. I just like the answers to this question. I\u2019d say BMW 5 Series because I feel like it\u2019s still luxury, it\u2019s classy, it\u2019s sporty, it\u2019s low to the ground, it has great handling and it\u2019s fast. Is there anything that you\u2019re concerned about with Harris? Weaknesses? I haven\u2019t been very happy with her anti-immigration position. I am Mexican, and I grew up in Mexico. And seeing her go and tell people, \u201cDon\u2019t come here,\u201d after my ancestors got here and made me happen, that was really disappointing and remains very disappointing. A lot of people don\u2019t really know much about Kamala Harris. You always heard Biden headlines about, oh, Biden is senile. But I cannot think of a single headline about Kamala. I would agree with Michael. I feel like there was not a whole lot about her that I heard. And the things I did hear were on social media. People like to make jokes and memes out of everyone. So I worry about that, moving forward, and being a strong, stern candidate is great. But I worry that they\u2019re going to use that as a way to attack her as being a woman and not being super caring, loving, not running like that. OK, but what do you think? Is that something that you perceive about her? I think it\u2019s a positive thing, as a woman who\u2019s independent. But I feel like a lot of people won\u2019t think that. Similarly to what Michael was saying, I didn\u2019t know much about her even three weeks ago. So I mean, it\u2019s gone from a base neutral of no knowledge to generally positive, after doing some research. I think that\u2019s probably why she was kept hidden for a long time. Because no news is good news. If she is under focus, there will be a lot of negativity if things don\u2019t go well. And that would have hurt now. I think it was all probably planned that this day was going to come at some point because of Biden\u2019s age. What about for you? I have a good connection because she is from the same country where I grew up in, from the same state. I\u2019ve been reading a lot of history, back from her mom and grandfather. I really hope that she would win. It\u2019s pride for me, personally, if she wins. We\u2019ve never had a woman president. And I\u2019m likely to see different things passed and how it\u2019s handled and see how she\u2019s able to navigate the country. OK. Who said the fact that she\u2019s a woman doesn\u2019t matter to them? I\u2019m just looking at the candidates and looking at who they are personally, simple as that. I know it\u2019s going to be a historic event if a woman is elected president. I just hope she can handle it. Because it\u2019s not an easy job. Tell me what you mean by that. Well, let\u2019s put it this way: If she comes up against Trump in a debate, how\u2019s she going to handle that? What do you think? He\u2019s going to throw a lot of mud at her. How do you think she\u2019ll handle it? Well, I hope that she can do a good job at handling the mud that\u2019s going to be slung at her. That\u2019s going to be the main thing, and that\u2019s probably going to be pretty emotional. But I think she can handle it. To what extent does the fact that Harris is a person of color make you more or less excited to vote for her, or does it not matter? [Three said \u201cMore excited\u201d; none said \u201cLess excited\u201d; nine said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d] I think it\u2019s a great thing to create history. When Obama won, it was so important, so major, to see the first Black president. I think just her being a woman of color would be a great thing for history. Farooq, you said it doesn\u2019t make a difference to you. We broke that color barrier. But I just look at the candidates themselves. Now, ideally, a female candidate would be historic, whether it be white, Black, brown. So color really didn\u2019t make much of a difference. We\u2019ve kind of already broken the color barrier. The fact that she\u2019s a woman would be more historic. Let\u2019s say Kamala Harris had taken truth serum so she had to answer any question honestly. What would you ask her? I would ask her how much actual experience does she have. I would ask her what her thoughts are on the economy and what issues were the most important for her to attack. What would you like her to say? I would like her to say that the economy is going to turn around and get better, inflation is going to go down and homelessness is going to go away. But that\u2019s a big hope. I would want to ask her, as a woman of color and product of immigrant parents, why she\u2019s not stepping up to protect immigrants seeking the same privileges and rights afforded to her. How do you think she\u2019d answer that question? I would hope she\u2019d be stumped. I would ask her how she\u2019s going to work with the other side, because that\u2019s really serious. You have to have a strategy. Yeah, how are you going to work with Congress to actually make things happen? Because that\u2019s where things always get stuck. How are you going to sway both sides to agree with what you\u2019re trying to do? How can you make it appeal to everyone? I would ask her if she has a plan on how to deal with the immigration problem and the system of how they\u2019re doing it. I would also ask about inflation and the economy. I would ask if she thinks she would win the election easily or if she fears that this country is not ready for a woman president. What do you think she\u2019s going to say to that? She will say she has a fair chance to try. Mahesh, can I ask you, just, do you think the country is ready for a woman president? Last time we had a woman presidential nominee, I felt it\u2019s not, right? It came very close. There\u2019s likely a chance that\u2019s going to happen again. She might come very close and lose. It\u2019s eight years since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. Do you think, Mahesh, that the country is more ready to elect a woman and have her win the presidency than it was eight years ago? People in the general population may be ready, yes, like myself. But I\u2019m not the deciding authority at the end. There\u2019s somebody else, the Electoral College. That hurts. The problem that Hillary faced was that she was a stern white woman. Kamala is a slick, stylish Black woman. And no matter how much racism there is in this country, people like style. They like people who push back. And it\u2019s much more attractive, I think, on Kamala. I think the country is much more ready. Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump \u2014 you had a very hardened career politician and a TV pop-culture rich dude going against each other. Everyone assumed Hillary was going to win. But Hillary is much more unfavorable to most people, just due to her problematic past, than Kamala is. Is there a kind of person that you would like to see Harris pick as her running mate? I think Pete Buttigieg, because Trump has shown his ass, so to speak, as far as being pretty anti-veteran. And Buttigieg is a veteran. He\u2019ll get those votes. The only person I can think of is Bernie Sanders. He\u2019s pretty popular with independent voters, which is pretty important this election. Mark Kelly, probably. Astronaut, armed forces \u2014 you can\u2019t go wrong. I\u2019d probably agree with Mark Kelly. Somebody that\u2019s going to help draw in more people to her candidacy, whether that\u2019s like somebody from a swing state or somebody who pulls more independent voters. If you could make one suggestion to Kamala Harris, what would it be? Don\u2019t give in to the bickering and letting Trump just pick little comments and fights. Don\u2019t get into it. Just be the bigger person, stand your ground and move on. Keep to the topics, not getting into personal life. I would actually like for her to occasionally get dirty with them. Because I know the Democrats have kind of taken the \u201cwe won\u2019t stoop to their level\u201d posture. I feel like at some point you have to put them in their place. So I hope she does kind of do that. Remain composed and stick to the plan. I\u2019m in the same boat as Shantae here. Harris was a prosecutor. She knows what she\u2019s doing when it comes to debating people. Raise your hand if you would say you\u2019re definitely committed to voting for Kamala Harris for president at this point. Everybody, it looks like, but Steve. You mentioned Robert Kennedy a few minutes ago. Well, I think he\u2019s a viable candidate. Unfortunately, he wouldn\u2019t win because the Democrats don\u2019t let him. They\u2019ve already demonstrated that they\u2019re going to try and railroad him out of the whole election. What would it take for Harris to win your vote? I need to see her stand her ground. If Biden was still in the race and his head was in a jar of formaldehyde, I\u2019d probably still vote for him. Is there anything you want to see her stand her ground on, or just generally stand her ground? Like I said, she\u2019s going to get a lot of mud. And that\u2019s going to be tough to deal with. I\u2019m pretty sure she can handle it. Jayden, can I ask you, did anything change for you recently that made you want to support Harris? I would just say it\u2019s someone new. And she seems very competent and capable to take office and actually voice her opinions and stand her ground. And she can articulate what she is trying to get across, which is a big thing. Bickering and an inability to speak is all I saw prior to now. How are you feeling about politics in America right now? I\u2019m nervous. I really am. Because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and who\u2019s going to win and what\u2019s going to be. I\u2019m nervous. I really don\u2019t like it. I\u2019m more disgusted, a little bit, with the politics that\u2019s been going on lately. Anything that\u2019s impacted you personally or just something that happened in politics that really bugged you? Yeah, I really did not like watching Roe v. Wade be overturned by the Supreme Court. That was a big turnoff for me. And then things being proposed by Biden and then it not going through Congress and then the bickering back and forth and then Trump not being held accountable and just me seeing, most recently, police brutality and a woman killed for no reason at all and nothing really being done about it, consistently. So I\u2019ve been very disgusted lately with just everything when it comes to politics. Jayden, you were nodding your head. I live in Madison, Wis. It\u2019s very, very liberal. So when Roe got overturned, we were all protesting. Campus was full of a lot of angry women and a lot of angry men, too, that understood why we were all upset about it. As long as she stands accountable for trying to fight for us to have a choice and have the ability to make that decision, I think a lot of people will choose to side with her, at least I hope. Would just as many people have sided with Biden, do you think? Or is it different with her? I think it\u2019s different. A lot of us didn\u2019t feel like Biden was actually able to act on things because he couldn\u2019t articulate and get the thoughts out. What has come up in your group chats about politics recently? Happiness. Conversations about who they think will be the running mate. I think that people have been a lot more easily convinced that Kamala Harris is a good option. A lot of jokes, memes and stuff. But it\u2019s primarily positive, which is reassuring to me, as opposed to Biden falling down a flight of stairs, with some stupid song behind it. It\u2019s been like, \u201cOh, look at how stylish Kamala is. Mother, we love her.\u201d Mother. [LAUGHING] Stuff like that. Has \u201cbrat\u201d come up or \u201ccoconut\u201d or other ones? It\u2019s popped up a few times, yeah. Positively, though. People were saying they\u2019re waiting for Taylor Swift and, you know, Beyonc\u00e9 to come out and watch it go from there. So let\u2019s say Trump wins in November and then we do this focus group four years from now at the end of his second term. How are you going to feel? What\u2019s going to be different about how things are going for you or the country? We survived four years before, so I would say I would still be hopeful. I\u2019m skeptical that he\u2019d make any difference in four years. So you don\u2019t think that anything will be really that different in four years? No. I think he\u2019ll be dead. I don\u2019t think anything will get better or worse or get better either way. I feel like it\u2019ll get worse. What will? I mean, you think we\u2019re divided right now? If he takes office, it\u2019s just going to be 10 times worse. I mean, the rhetoric that\u2019s being spread right now, through that party, is basically sounding like they are going to make changes that people are not going to like. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be any better at all. What\u2019ll be worse? Well, just the divisiveness in the parties. And they\u2019re going to run around and start throwing stuff at each other. And nothing\u2019s going to get done. Let\u2019s say Kamala Harris wins in November and we do this group again four years from now, toward the end of her term. What\u2019s going to be different? What\u2019s going to be the same? How are you going to feel? I think that we\u2019ll still be somewhat divided but a lot more people will be hopeful. Just making it easier for people to have a better quality of life. I\u2019m hoping that abortion is legal in all cases. And I hope climate change is addressed. But I just don\u2019t think things will happen in four years. It\u2019ll take a lot longer. I think by the time we get to those four years, the waters will have melted in Antarctica. But she\u2019s going to handle it. Still, it\u2019s going to be a very stressful situation for her. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll be significantly more positive. But I have a lot of faith that it won\u2019t be worse, which is really a bare minimum that I ask for at this point. America in Focus seeks to hear and understand the views of cross-sections of Americans whose voices are often not heard in opinion journalism.

  "2025-04-26_847488_1": "Supported by Students across New York City are waiting up to an hour for school buses, as a driver shortage and conflict over a contract hamstring the city\u2019s ability to find a solution. Less than a month into the school year, Dawn Akerley has developed a very particular morning routine. She dashes outside at around 7 a.m., when her son\u2019s school bus is supposed to arrive, to see whether it is waiting at the curb. Often, it is not. She leaves her son, Jace, who is 6 years old and autistic, unattended inside their Queens apartment as she runs out every 20 minutes until the bus shows up, some days as late as 8:30 a.m. The bus route originates in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and stretches about 20 miles east to Far Rockaway, Queens, before Jace is picked up in Richmond Hill, a neighborhood 10 miles to the north. The driver bypasses his school and stops at two others before dropping Jace off. Most days, Ms. Akerley said, he does not get to school until 10 a.m. \u2014 two hours late. \u201cIt\u2019s so detrimental to his entire day,\u201d she said, adding that Jace had failed his first math test of the year because he was consistently missing class. Ms. Akerley is just one of many New York City parents whose children use school buses and are not being picked up on time. A broad swath of those parents have children with disabilities or learning differences that require the city to provide a special education plan, which not only guarantees their right to transportation, but also stipulates that they cannot spend more than 90 minutes getting to school. Students from kindergarten through sixth grade who live more than a mile from school are also eligible for bus transportation. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

  "2025-04-26_335519_1": "What to Read Supported by nonfiction In \u201cEmpresses of Seventh Avenue,\u201d the fashion writer Nancy MacDonell tells the story of the New York women who created modern style. Caroline Weber, a professor of French and comparative literature at Barnard College and Columbia University, is a frequent contributor to the Book Review. When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. EMPRESSES OF SEVENTH AVENUE: World War II, New York City, and the Birth of American Fashion, by Nancy MacDonell \u201cElegance is refusal,\u201d Coco Chanel reportedly said. Pierre Balmain reminded his customers, \u201cRigor, always rigor,\u201d while Karl Lagerfeld, taking aim at the non-rigorous, specified, \u201cSweatpants are a sign of defeat.\u201d For Sonia Rykiel\u2019s part? \u201cHow can you live the high life if you do not wear the high heels?\u201d The authority of France\u2019s great fashion designers has long resided not only in their glamorous creations but in their oft-cited diktats. And reflecting the axiomatic French equation of beauty with suffering, these statements posit discipline, even discomfort, as the necessary precondition of chic. How fortunate for those of us with a weakness for sweats and flat shoes that the heroines of Nancy MacDonell\u2019s engaging new book, \u201cEmpresses of Seventh Avenue: World War II, New York City, and the Birth of American Fashion,\u201d came along and freed American women from the tyranny of haute Gallic style. Before World War II, that tyranny was as absolute in New York, the center of the American garment trade, as it was in Paris, the birthplace and capital of French couture. The latter industry supplied (and still supplies) elaborately constructed, dizzyingly expensive and predominantly formal bespoke confections to an elite clientele of just a few hundred people worldwide. But it also provided the inspiration for the mass-produced couture copies that, after the end of World War I, came to dominate the women\u2019s clothing market in America. Little did it matter to garment executives stateside that, as MacDonell observes, \u201cwomen who ordered their wardrobes from haute couture houses led completely different lives, with completely different needs, from women who shopped for ready-to-wear on a budget.\u201d Nor did it concern them that a dress worn by a marquise to \u201cthe races at Auteuil\u201d \u2014 a woman with an unlimited budget, servants and \u201cfreedom from quotidian concerns like work\u201d \u2014 made little sense on \u201ca typist in Brooklyn\u201d en route to Coney Island. So it was that, until history intervened, the U.S. apparel industry force-fed female customers a steady diet of clothes they did not want or need, prompting the American designer Elizabeth Hawes in 1938 to coin a catchy maxim of her own: \u201cFashion is spinach.\u201d How Hawes and several other forward-thinking American women weaned their compatriots off sartorial greens is the remarkable story that MacDonell, a fashion columnist for The Wall Street Journal, recounts in lively prose and rich historical detail. The precipitating event is the Third Reich\u2019s invasion of Paris in June 1940 and the city\u2019s subsequent four-year occupation by the Nazis. This period was a dark one for France\u2019s couturiers, who were reduced to either closing their fashion houses or dressing the occasional Nazi officer\u2019s wife.

  "2025-04-26_873686_1": "Supported by In presidential politics, campaigns are powered by billionaires. Here is a look at the most influential givers. Follow the latest updates on the Harris and Trump campaigns. In presidential fund-raising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big. The very small are the lifeblood of campaigns, cultivated via email after email, and hounded for recurring donations. But the very, very big can make contributions that eclipse a million small-dollar donors. The campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump, when combined with their super PACs, have raised $1.3 billion, and that\u2019s not counting money raised by dark-money organizations that are active in the presidential race and don\u2019t disclose their donors. The final two months of the election typically see donors write some of the biggest checks of the campaign season. So we\u2019re just getting started. Here\u2019s a look at the billionaires that are powering the campaigns. Mr. Trump has not added many new megadonors to his fold since his 2020 campaign. He himself has not traveled to many fund-raising events across the country \u2014 a point of frustration for some of his fund-raisers who sometimes have to travel to Mr. Trump\u2019s own properties to get access to the candidate. Some traditional Republican donors who are uncomfortable with Mr. Trump are focusing their energies on down-ballot campaigns. But Mr. Trump has, since 2016, transformed the Republican contributor class, developing a network of peculiar big donors loyal to him. There is no donor who has publicly spent more for Mr. Trump this cycle than Timothy Mellon, heir to the Mellon banking fortune. He has put more than $125 million into Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 and it\u2019s only September. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_277347_1": "Trump Administration Supported by Candidates in both parties who lost by small margins in 2022 are trying to mount comebacks. Their races could determine which party wins control of the House. Reporting from Washington Joe Kent, a far-right Republican and former Army Special Forces officer, ran for Congress two years ago as a partisan warrior. He denied that President Biden had won the 2020 election, supported rioters charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress and favored banning abortions nationwide. He lost. Now Mr. Kent is approaching a rematch against the Democrat who vanquished him in a competitive district in southern Washington, Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, with a starkly different tone, emphasizing local issues and his personal story. \u201cMy campaign and I have talked with local leaders, past volunteers and activists to seek their advice,\u201d Mr. Kent said in a campaign video, in which he talked about what he learned during his first campaign and is doing differently this time. \u201cI\u2019m expanding my campaign\u2019s focus to local challenges,\u201d he adds, as well as doing \u201cmore outreach to a broader base of voters.\u201d His is just one of more than a dozen congressional races this year, some of them in critical battlegrounds, that will offer voters the same choices they had in 2022, featuring both Republican and Democratic challengers seeking to unseat an incumbent they\u2019ve already faced and lost to at least once before. These near miss contenders are returning to the campaign trail with heightened name recognition, established fund-raising networks, battle-tested campaign apparatuses and lessons learned from their failed bids that they hope will help them win this time. Their success or failure will help determine who wins control of the closely divided House in November. In California, Representative John Duarte bested his Democratic challenger, Adam Gray, by just a few hundred votes two years ago in one of the closest House races in the nation. The victory was a key pickup for Republicans that helped them take power in the House. This year, Democrats are aggressively targeting the seat once again.

  "2025-04-26_724883_1": "Supported by Activists have renewed attention on legislation related to the emotional issue of so-called medical aid in dying that has long languished in Albany. Reporting from the State Capitol in Albany, N.Y. The sounds of protest came forcefully from the Assembly chamber gallery, the chants echoing the words emblazoned on handmade banners that were held aloft: \u201cStop the suffering, pass the bill!\u201d But as New York State troopers began to remove some of the protesters \u2014 some holding canes, others slowed by the effects of cancer treatment \u2014 it was clear that this demonstration held personal and immediate resonance to those participating. The protest was the latest in an increasingly desperate series of demonstrations aimed at persuading state legislators to pass a bill that would legalize so-called medical aid in dying, allowing terminally ill people access to life-ending medication for the first time in the state. New York is one of 19 states where lawmakers are considering bills that would legalize medical aid in dying, a practice that is legal in 10 states and Washington, D.C. The bill in New York would allow mentally competent, terminally ill adults with no more than six months to live to request prescriptions from their doctors for life-ending medication. The patients would have to be able to ingest the medication on their own, and only the person seeking to die could request the prescription. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who enjoys conflict or who has much experience in civil disobedience,\u201d said Jules Netherland, a protester who was detained in the Capitol. \u201cBut I really believed this was the only way to get people\u2019s attention.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_7738_1": "Trump Administration Donald J. Trump is expected to participate in a Fox News town hall on the same day, the network announced Tuesday. A Republican presidential primary debate that CNN plans to host in Des Moines will be a one-on-one showdown between Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, who are fighting to emerge from the state\u2019s caucuses as the definitive alternative to former President Donald J. Trump. Both Mr. DeSantis, the governor of Florida, and Ms. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, are long shots to win the caucuses, given that they are trailing Mr. Trump in polls of Iowans by more than 30 points on average. But if either one is to have even a small chance of claiming the nomination, that person needs to drive the other out of the race, which they could do \u2014 or at least take a first step toward doing \u2014 by beating them for second place in Iowa. Mr. Trump did not participate in the official debates sponsored by the Republican National Committee last year, and he will not participate in the CNN debate in Iowa either. (The Iowa event will be followed by a similar one in New Hampshire.) And no other candidate qualified by the deadline on Tuesday. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_702662_1": "Supported by Guest Essay Mr. Duss is the executive vice president of the Center for International Policy. He was a foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders. Dr. Okail is the president and chief executive of the Center for International Policy. The assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Tuesday \u2014 presumably carried out by Israel \u2014 has likely halted Gaza cease-fire talks and a hostage deal for the time being. It has also brought the region one step closer to an all-out conflagration. Indeed, within hours, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared his intention to attack Israel. The almost certain escalation from the Haniyeh assassination signals a fundamental flaw in President Biden\u2019s Gaza policy: the hope that the Gaza war could be contained to Gaza. The possibility of regional conflict has always been Mr. Biden\u2019s real red line. But for months, the war has already been spreading \u2014 to Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and now, to Iran. The fact that it hasn\u2019t yet erupted into even more widespread and intense conflict is the result of both diplomatic skill and a lot of luck, the latter of which appears to be running out. Some in the U.S. foreign policy establishment argue that since neither the United States nor Iran desires full-scale war, cooler heads will prevail. But once uncorked, this kind of violence usually cannot be controlled. It\u2019s important to understand that even if we are able to step back from the brink now, as we all must hope, this policy is both a moral and strategic failure, with consequences and costs in human lives, to U.S. credibility and to the so-called rules-based order we haven\u2019t begun to comprehend. The current precarious moment is the result of a series of false assumptions that U.S. policy was built on since well before the war began. On Oct. 6, the United States was heavily focused on stitching up an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, premised in part on the idea that the Palestinian people could simply be caged in perpetuity, with a few upgrades here and there to the military occupation they have endured for nearly six decades, and a few nominal commitments to someday, maybe, end that occupation. The Oct. 7 attacks showed this to be a fantasy. In the months after, the Biden administration delayed calls for a cease-fire, in the face of large-scale global and domestic protest and internal government dissent, while emboldening Israel\u2019s right-wing government with both the sale of arms and political support. At the same time, regional conflict steadily spread. Rocket fire from Lebanon began almost immediately after Oct. 7, driving tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes in the north and leaving some 60,000 internally displaced with no prospect of when they might return. Attacks by Yemen\u2019s Houthi forces on shipping routes in the Red Sea imposed a burden on the global economy as freight costs more than doubled in January. Attacks by Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq on U.S. interests culminated in a drone attack on an American base in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members at the beginning of the year, to which the United States retaliated with strikes of its own. An Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic facility in Damascus, Syria, in April resulted in an Iranian drone and missile attack on central Israel in retaliation. Thankfully almost all of those drones and missiles were intercepted via a skillful U.S.-coordinated regional defense effort (a 7-year-old girl was seriously injured), but it was impossible to miss the significance of Iran directly striking inside Israel for the first time. Last month, a Houthi drone penetrated Israel\u2019s air defenses and hit downtown Tel Aviv \u2014 to which Israel responded by striking Yemen for the first time. On July 27, a rocket strike on the town of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, which Israel blamed on Hezbollah, killed 12 children and teenagers, to which Israel responded with an airstrike on southern Beirut, killing Hezbollah\u2019s senior military commander and further widening the circle of conflict. With each new red line crossed, the risk of escalation increases, and Washington should not underestimate either the willingness of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to drag the United States into a disastrous war, nor the potential for Iran to engage militarily or worse, to finally decide to commit fully to developing a nuclear deterrent. And yet, rather than see a series of desperately close calls as evidence of the urgency to end the Gaza war, Washington chose to view it as proof of its ability to contain escalation. The Biden administration has consistently refused to leverage its continuing supply of arms to Israel to bring the fighting to a halt, even appearing to sidestep U.S. law to continue doing so. Mr. Biden\u2019s announcement in late May of a permanent cease-fire proposal was an important effort to try to secure a war-ending agreement, but that gambit was undermined by his continuing refusal to offer an ultimatum to Mr. Netanyahu. The Republican Party\u2019s recent stunt of inviting the prime minister to address Congress, with which the Democratic congressional leadership irresponsibly cooperated, predictably further emboldened Mr. Netanyahu to continue stalling a cease-fire. It is also essential to underscore that, as with previous assassinations of militant leaders in Lebanon, the precision with which Mr. Haniyeh was apparently dispatched shows that targeting Hamas leadership in Gaza might have benefited from an entirely different military strategy. While the effort to rout Hamas militants was of a broader scale, surely it could have been carried out without devastatingly widespread casualties and mass destruction of houses, schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure that will require a generation or more to rebuild. It remains to be seen what the long-term consequences of the Gaza war will be. It\u2019s already clear, however, that this catastrophe was enabled by Washington\u2019s false belief in its ability to manage and control the spread of violence. Shattering this dangerous illusion is an essential step in crafting a U.S. foreign policy fit for this historical moment At the time of this writing, a ground war in Lebanon and devastating, sustained missile barrages may still be staved off, but to do so will require deft, immediate diplomacy and actionable changes on the pipeline of arms to Israel. That will necessitate more action than we have seen in the last 10 months, leading us to worry that the conflagration may occur as much as the Americans would like to wish it away. The time is late, but it is essential now for President Biden to finally apply real pressure to stop this war, by halting the supply of offensive arms, facilitating the return of hostages to Israel and enabling the provision of desperately needed humanitarian aid into Gaza. The United States must state loudly and clearly that the country will no longer support this war. And then show that it means it.

  "2025-04-26_173468_1": "Trump Administration  New plagiarism allegations that surfaced on Monday against Claudine Gay threatened to mire Harvard deeper in debate over what constitutes plagiarism and whether the university would hold its president and its students to the same standard. The accusations were circulated through an unsigned complaint published Monday in The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative online journal that has led a campaign against Dr. Gay over the past few weeks. The new complaint added additional accusations of plagiarism to about 40 that had already been circulated in the same way, apparently by the same accuser. Dr. Gay has strongly defended her work. \u201cI stand by the integrity of my scholarship,\u201d she said in a statement on Dec. 11, when the initial plagiarism charges were being circulated by conservative activists online and the Harvard Corporation was considering whether she should remain as president. \u201cThroughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards,\u201d Dr. Gay said. The documents by the unnamed accuser that The Free Beacon links to on its website show 39 examples in the first complaint, rising to 47 in total in the second complaint. Separately, Harvard\u2019s investigations have found instances of inadequate citation in her dissertation and at least two of her articles. She has not been accused of stealing big ideas, but rather of copying language in the papers of other scholars, with small changes to substitute words or phrases or to arrange them differently.

  "2025-04-26_6829_1": "What to Watch Supported by A new FX sitcom handles the educational culture wars with a light touch. The culture war often doesn\u2019t have a physical frontline; it\u2019s fought in op-ed columns, through social-media memes and inside people\u2019s heads. Public schools are an exception. There, the state infantry of teachers, enlisted to handle potentially explosive ideas, face wave after wave of challenging students, backed by air support from helicopter parents. \u201cEnglish Teacher,\u201d which begins Monday on FX, is a deft, brutal trench comedy of this battle. Brian Jordan Alvarez, the creator and viral-video comic, stars as Evan Marquez, a high school teacher in suburban Austin, Texas, struggling to get through each day with his ideals intact and his shirts unstained. His students are wily shape-shifters, a tech-enabled alien species whose ways and attitudes keep their handlers off-balance. \u201cThe kids this year, I feel like they\u2019re less woke,\u201d Evan tells his best friend, the history teacher Gwen Sanders (Stephanie Koenig), who concurs. One student, she said, told her she needed to teach \u201cboth sides\u201d of the Spanish Inquisition. Evan\u2019s real troubles begin, however, when he learns that he\u2019s under \u201cinvestigation\u201d after a rich, influential parent reported him for having kissed his ex-boyfriend (Jordan Firstman) in front of students. His principal, Grant Moretti \u2014 a walking anxiety attack played wonderfully by Enrico Colantoni \u2014 admits that Evan shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this, but he\u2019s too beaten and besieged to do anything but plead with Evan to help him make the problem go away. One of Evan\u2019s students suggests he claim discrimination as a gay Hispanic, but another says, \u201cGay doesn\u2019t count anymore, and he talks like a straight white guy.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Reporting from Zaragoza, Spain Jennifer Hermoso, the Spanish soccer star who received an unsolicited kiss on the mouth after her team won the World Cup, gave evidence in Spain\u2019s National Court Tuesday morning against Luis Rubiales, the former Spanish soccer boss who is being investigated over allegations of sexual assault and coercion in connection with the episode. Ms. Hermoso\u2019s testimony concludes the high-profile criminal inquiry of Mr. Rubiales, which was opened days after the World Cup, which took place in Sydney, Australia, in August. A judge, Francisco de Jorge, must now decide whether to charge Mr. Rubiales or to close the case. If Judge de Jorge concludes there is evidence of wrongdoing, Mr. Rubiales will face trial on a sexual assault charge \u2014 punishable with between one and four years in prison. Mr. Rubiales and three executives at the soccer federation, including the former coach, Jorge Vilda, may also face charges of coercion after they were accused of exerting pressure on Ms. Hermoso to show support for Mr. Rubiales. Mr. Rubiales has denied the charges, saying that it was nothing more than a \u201cpeck.\u201d On Tuesday morning, Ms. Hermoso was the last in a string of Spanish sporting celebrities to give evidence. The list of witnesses summoned by Judge de Jorge reads like the \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of Spanish soccer, with stars such as Alexia Putellas, the current Best FIFA Women\u2019s Player; Misa Rodr\u00edguez, the goalkeeper for Real Madrid; and Irene Paredes, Barcelona\u2019s star defender.

Ms. Hermoso spoke to the press outside Spain\u2019s National Court after her appearance. \u201cAll is in the hands of justice,\u201d she said, seemingly at ease. What exactly she or the other witnesses disclosed to Judge de Jorge has not been made public officially as the hearings have been held behind closed doors. But shortly after Ms. Hermoso left court this morning, the Spanish prosecutor\u2019s office issued a statement confirming that she had testified that \u201cthe kiss was unexpected and at no point consented.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

His felony conviction on Thursday, delivered by a jury of 12 Manhattan residents, brought with it the possibility that he could eventually be imprisoned in New York, a far cry from the image he spent decades cultivating as a real estate mogul and man about town. Former President Donald J. Trump faced 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, related to the reimbursement of hush money paid to the porn star Stormy Daniels in order to cover up a sex scandal around the 2016 presidential election. In February, Mr. Trump endured another humiliation: a judgment of more than $450 million in a civil fraud case brought by the state\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, for overvaluing his net worth.

  "2025-04-26_534933_1": "Supported by Therapists, researchers and an etiquette expert weigh in on when you can disappear with a clear conscience and the ways to get around it. About a decade ago, Brenna Holeman was on the perfect first date with a man she\u2019d met on a dating app. It was a rainy night in a cozy London bar, and before the date even ended \u2014 with a kiss \u2014 they\u2019d breathlessly made plans for their next rendezvous. \u201cHe even texted me that night saying, \u2018I can\u2019t stop smiling,\u2019\u201d recalled Ms. Holeman, 40, a travel writer now based in Canada. He also wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you again,\u201d she added. But when she texted to confirm the timing for their next date, there was radio silence. Ghosting, the popular term for cutting off all communication without explanation, has become an inescapable part of modern dating. And it can be even harder to stomach than flat-out rejection, psychologists and researchers said, because it involves uncertainty. Elizabeth Earnshaw, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Philadelphia, said people who have been ghosted \u201cstart to question their reality.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re looking back and saying: \u2018Where did I miss the signs? What is wrong with me that I thought we had so much fun on our last date?\u2019\u201d Ms. Earnshaw said. She has seen many clients \u2014 of various ages, genders and sexual orientations \u2014 grappling with a \u201ccrisis of self-esteem\u201d after being repeatedly ghosted. But in a fast-paced world of dating apps and endless options, is it ever OK to ghost? Therapists, researchers and an etiquette expert weighed in on when you can ghost with a clear conscience, and the ways to get around it. Though ghosting is still a relatively new area of research, some data is starting to emerge. In one 2019 study, 25 percent of participants said they\u2019d been ghosted by a romantic partner, and just over 20 percent said they had ghosted someone themselves. Another small study, which specifically surveyed dating app users, found that 85 percent had been ghosted at some point, which led many respondents to feel sad or angry and experience lower self-esteem; some also felt more distrustful of the world. People who have been ghosted have a tendency to ruminate, wondering: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is this person not responding to me?\u201d said Richard Slatcher, a professor of psychology at the University of Georgia who studies close relationships. \u201cAlong with that is a real lack of closure for people.\u201d Therapists like Ms. Earnshaw have been seeing the fallout from ghosting in their practices for years, particularly as people have burned out on dating apps. People really shouldn\u2019t ghost if they can help it, because of the hurt it can cause, especially when it happens repeatedly, she said. She said her clients ask, \u201cAm I doing something that\u2019s creating this over and over again?\u201d Some even wonder, \u201cHow could I be so worthless that someone would not care to say goodbye?\u201d Still, there are times when it is appropriate, even wise, to ghost, the experts said. If the person has been aggressive or made you feel unsafe, you are justified in walking away without explanation, Ms. Earnshaw said. She also gave the green light if a person is simply not respecting your boundaries. \u201cIf they\u2019re just not listening to what you\u2019ve already expressed, then I think it\u2019s OK,\u201d Ms. Earnshaw said, adding that she hesitates to even categorize that situation as ghosting. In the study that found most online daters have been ghosted, the reasons people gave for disappearing were complex: Some did so because they feared verbally abusive or even stalking behavior; others said they didn\u2019t feel they owed anything to the person they were talking to on an app; and some said they did not want to hurt anyone by rejecting them verbally. \u201cSometimes, for the person who is doing the disappearing, it\u2019s just easier,\u201d said Rachel Sussman, a psychotherapist in New York City who is the author of \u201cThe Breakup Bible.\u201d \u201cNobody likes delivering bad news,\u201d she added. Ms. Earnshaw said that a useful question to ask yourself before ghosting someone is: Am I thinking about ghosting this person simply because I want to avoid an unpleasant conversation? If the answer is yes, it is kinder to offer a goodbye and even a brief explanation. If you have been on only one or two dates, a text ending things is usually sufficient, said Elaine Swann, an etiquette expert in Carlsbad, Calif. She acknowledged that might be surprising advice from a stickler for manners, but she said that etiquette evolves. Keep it brief, she recommended, something along the lines of: \u201cI don\u2019t think we are a good fit, but best wishes to you and I hope you find the connection you are looking for.\u201d If, however, you have gone on more than a date or two or been physically intimate in any way \u2014 \u201ceven just making out!\u201d \u2014 Ms. Swann believes breaking up in person or with a phone call is in order. (Or, if you cannot stomach that, a voice mail message or voice memo could work, she said.) It is important that the other person hears your voice and your tone, Ms. Swann said. And do not try to \u201cfix\u201d the person on your way out. \u201cYou do not need to make this a teachable moment,\u201d she said. Ms. Sussman said she often tells her clients that even if they have had a really good date (or several), they can protect against emotional turmoil by simply telling themselves ahead of time that they may not hear from the person again. Remember that ghosting is unfortunately now \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201chappens to everyone,\u201d she said, adding that she has heard these stories from clients of all kinds. \u201cEven the supermodel is saying: \u2018Oh, I shouldn\u2019t have said this, or I shouldn\u2019t have worn that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sussman said. But be gentle with yourself. The days and weeks after being ghosted are a good time to practice emotional self-care, Ms. Earnshaw said. See friends, write in a journal, lean into a hobby or move your body, she said. At the same time, you can help lessen the damage to your self-esteem by simply reminding yourself \u2014 as often as you need to \u2014 that it probably wasn\u2019t about you, Ms. Sussman said. After her perfect London date, Ms. Holeman was ghosted once more by someone she\u2019d been seeing for months. She blogged about her experiences nearly a decade ago in what became her most popular post, and readers shared their own ghost stories. Opening up about the experiences was cathartic and eye-opening for Ms. Holeman as she recovered from her \u201cspiral of anxiety,\u201d she said. Her initial confusion and hurt subsided, and she realized that silence sometimes speaks volumes. \u201cThis person was showing me who he was,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was showing me that he was immature, lacks empathy and couldn\u2019t be bothered to even send a quick text.\u201d She then added, \u201cThe biggest realization for me to move on was, \u2018Oh.

Trump\u2019s case closed off many avenues of appeal, experts said, though his lawyers might challenge the novel theory at the case\u2019s center. \u201cThis is long from over,\u201d Donald J. Trump, the former president and current felon, declared on Thursday, moments after a Manhattan jury convicted him on 34 counts of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal. Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, is banking on the jury not having the final word on the case. He has already outlined a plan to appeal a verdict that on Friday he labeled \u201ca scam.\u201d But even if the former \u2014 and possibly future \u2014 president could persuade voters to ignore his conviction, the appellate courts might not be so sympathetic. Several legal experts cast doubt on his chances of success, and noted that the case could take years to snake through the courts, all but ensuring he will still be a felon when voters head to the polls in November. And so, after a five-year investigation and a seven-week trial, Mr. Trump\u2019s New York legal odyssey is only beginning. Former President Donald J. Trump faced 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, related to the reimbursement of hush money paid to the porn star Stormy Daniels in order to cover up a sex scandal around the 2016 presidential election. The former president\u2019s supporters are calling on the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, though that is highly unlikely. In a more likely appeal to a New York court, Mr. Trump would have avenues to attack the conviction, the experts said, but far fewer than he has claimed. The experts noted that the judge whose rulings helped shape the case stripped some of the prosecution\u2019s most precarious arguments and evidence from the trial.

  "2025-04-26_9671_1": "Trump Administration Supported by Donald J. Trump isn\u2019t the first candidate to run afoul of the ban on partisan activity in Arlington National Cemetery. But no one else has responded as hostilely as his campaign has. Chris Cameron was with former President Donald J. Trump when he visited Arlington National Cemetery last week. He reported from Washington. Follow the latest updates on the Harris and Trump campaigns. In November 1999, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican and former prisoner of war in Vietnam who was widely considered a military hero, said that his newly launched presidential campaign had made \u201ca very bad mistake.\u201d Mr. McCain, who at the time was trailing far behind George W. Bush in the race for their party\u2019s nomination, had produced a campaign ad highlighting his career as a Navy pilot and his reverence for his fellow service members. At one moment, the ad showed Mr. McCain walking solemnly through Arlington National Cemetery. The Army soon said that Mr. McCain\u2019s campaign had never requested permission to film in the cemetery. Even if it had, an Army spokesman said at the time, the request would have been denied because partisan activity is banned at Army installations. A campaign spokesman said that the clip had come from one of the senator\u2019s periodic visits to the graves of his father and his grandfather. It was an incident in campaign politics that closely mirrored, before it sharply diverged from, another that took place last week. An Army spokesman said on Thursday that former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign had similarly not been given permission to film in a restricted area of Arlington National Cemetery during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit on Monday \u2014 and that it could not have received such permission because it would violate federal law. The Army issued a rare public rebuke of Trump campaign officials for attacks they directed at a cemetery worker who had tried to stop the filming. (A campaign spokesman had accused the worker of experiencing a \u201cmental health episode.\u201d) The Trump campaign had been made aware that filming for campaign purposes was against Army regulations \u2014 and campaign officials had nonetheless plowed forward, even, according to the Army, physically pushing aside the cemetery worker. Mr. Trump and his campaign published photos and video of the former president laying flowers and flashing a thumbs-up at the graves of Marines killed during the withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago. Other graves are visible in the footage, including one of a Green Beret who died by suicide. The images are still online. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

And I\u2019m the director of \u2018The Color Purple.\u2019\u201d [SNAPPING] \u201cSo, this scene is where Shug Avery, played by the incredible Taraji P. Henson, performs at the juke joint for the very first time. Her character\u2019s enigmatic. We\u2019ve been hearing about her throughout. And we haven\u2019t seen her perform yet. And so, Dan Laustsen my DP, and I, knew that this was a moment that would have to register in the audience\u2019s mind as a moment of coming out, of sorts. My production designer, Paul Austerberry also really suggested that we do this practically and not on stage. And so, we found a swamp that we had to drain. It takes two months to drain out and two months to fill back up. But we drained it out to build the actual juke joint. And so, what you\u2019re seeing is Shug actually performing in a juke joint on location. And what was special about this was, also, it gave my choreographer, the incredible Fatima Robinson, the opportunity to really shine. And it took us about two weeks of rehearsals to figure out just the blocking for this. A lot was going to be going on. A lot of storytelling was going to be happening. And a lot of bodies were going to be moving in this space.\u201d \u201c(SINGING) Push the button.\u201d \u201c(SINGING) Push the button.\u201d \u201c(SINGING) Push the button.\u201d \u201cIt was very important that the blocking was right. It was also very important that we gave Taraji an opportunity to shine in this moment. She actually sung the song herself. She\u2019s not dubbed. This is actually her voice. She took vocal lessons to make sure she got this one right. And it was incredible because it was all believable for her in the space, performing this song in real time. This is where it gets special, when the lights go out. And we find ourselves in darkness. Now, for me, this is a moment that also allows the dance break to be a special moment. The song is a bit long. So, we knew that we didn\u2019t want the audiences just sitting through a redundant setup. So, I remember coming in to set one day much earlier. And the lights were \u2014 the environmental lights were on. And the blue light started to bleed through. I said to myself, I think that\u2019s it. If we can go from light to darkness this way. I think we could have something special.\u201d \u201cOoh, it ain\u2019t over yet, y\u2019all.\u201d \u201cNow, ladies.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI need you to work a little harder, O.K.?\u201d \u201cThe other thing that was special about this moment is the ending, when we find out that Shug Avery has actually chosen Celie and not Mister. So, there was a lot of storytelling. Even though it\u2019s a big dance number, there\u2019s still a lot of storytelling going on. So, by the time we find out that she\u2019s kind of made this choice, it\u2019s too late for Mister. Mister has been waiting. He\u2019s spent all this time, expecting that Shug Avery would come to him at the end of this performance. And he would be the beneficiary of all of this amazingness that\u2019s happened. And somehow, she kind of just sneaks past him and goes to Celie. And that\u2019s a big emotional and romantic moment in this film. And I think that it was really special. And I love the look on Colman\u2019s face when the realization hits him. It\u2019s like, wow, all this for nothing.\u201d [CHEERS] 3:30 1:39 2:00 5:18 3:06 4:21 3:56 3:00 3:37 3:33 1:34 3:15 We encourage you to review our updated Terms of Sale, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy.

Though these preparations promise browned bits and quicker cook times, not all glow-ups are worth the effort. In tests with various brands of hot dogs (including beef, pork, poultry and plant-based) on charcoal and gas grills, and a campfire, on their own and in buns with toppings, the soundest method for consistently snappy sizzled hot dogs was also the most straightforward.

But a series of crucial turning points led to this week\u2019s indictment. One year ago this week, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s investigation into Donald J. Trump appeared to be dead in the water. The two leaders of the investigation had recently resigned after the new district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, decided not to charge Mr. Trump at that point. Amid a fierce backlash to his decision \u2014 and a brutal start to his tenure \u2014 Mr. Bragg insisted that the investigation was not over.

For a time, their efforts were haphazard as they examined a wide range of Mr. Trump\u2019s business practices, including whether he had lied about his net worth, which was the focus of the investigation when Mr. Bragg had declined to seek an indictment.

But a U.S. official said to expect Israel to assassinate Hamas officials \u201cfor years.\u201d Hamas on Tuesday accused Israel of killing Saleh al-Arouri, a top leader of the group, along with two commanders from its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. Mr. al-Arouri is the senior-most Hamas figure to be killed since Israel vowed to destroy the organization and eliminate its leadership after a deadly Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7. Mr. al-Arouri was assassinated in an explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon\u2019s capital, marking the first such assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years. It comes as officials across the region are worried about the war in Gaza igniting a wider conflagration. Israeli officials would not comment on whether their forces had targeted Mr. al-Arouri, but officials from Lebanon and the United States ascribed the attack to Israel. A senior U.S. official said it was most likely the first of many strikes that Israel would carry out against Hamas operatives connected to the Oct. 7 assault. \u201cNo one is safe if they had any hand in planning, raising money for or carrying out these attacks,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal discussions. Citing Israel\u2019s vow to hunt down the perpetrators of the Oct. 7 attack wherever they are, the official added, \u201cThis is just the beginning, and it\u2019ll go on for years.\u201d The explosion shattered the tense calm that had prevailed in Beirut ever since Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militant group that is a Hamas ally, began clashing with Israeli forces in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. Unlike southern Lebanon, which has been engulfed by the fighting and has seen tens of thousands of people displaced, Beirut had not been targeted in the conflict.

Linking up with an underdog, mission-focused fashion brand is also a way for Nigeria, which is sending a delegation of about 200 to the Games, to capture attention and enthusiasm, much the way Liberia did when it teamed with Telfar for its Olympic looks in 2021. (Though Actively Black dressed the Nigerians who walked in the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in 2022, there were only two of them; now the delegation has critical mass.) \u201cPart of that Nigeria vibe is you\u2019re going to look nice,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI know we have to show up in a way that represents that. As a former athlete, you love that competition, that challenge.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Reporting from Paris Under the golden dome of Les Invalides, the 17th-century monument where Napoleon is entombed, and on the penultimate day of fashion month, Balenciaga built a giant black box \u2014 the better to house a 154-foot long (47-meter) wooden dining table, polished to a high sheen. Not because, as some guests posited, the brand\u2019s mononymous creative director, Demna, wanted to issue some pointed social commentary on who gets a seat at the table (Answer: Nicole Kidman, Katy Perry, the WNBA player Cameron Brink, various brand pooh-bahs and various editor in chiefs). And not because Demna was hinting this was his last supper, though given the freneticism of the rumor mill currently spinning in fashion, it would not have been out of character for him to juice it a bit. But because, he said backstage afterward, as a teenager he was endlessly drawing fashion collections and showing them to his family at the dining table, and that was \u201cthe beginning of my, I don\u2019t know, obsession, or what I would call a marriage, to this job.\u201d It is, he said, \u201cprobably one of the longest relationships I\u2019ve been in.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s why he started the collection with a white lace bra, girdle, garter belt and stockings. Sex, it seemed, was back on the menu. Spicy. This wasn\u2019t the first time a tabletop had become a runway \u2014 Dries Van Noten did it in 2004 \u2014 but it has been awhile. It has also been an oddly neutered season. The in-your-face-with-my-flesh naked dressing prevalent not that long ago has practically disappeared from the catwalks. Maybe it\u2019s simply a backlash to what came before or maybe it\u2019s due to a general free-floating anxiety about the state of \u2014 well, almost everything \u2014 that has created a sort of big-brand paralysis. Or maybe it\u2019s the widespread tiptoeing around about what sexy is and who gets to define it, but there has been more covering than uncovering when it comes to the body. Even the lingerie touches popping up in various shows are not so much provocative as polite; about a certain kind of dressing, rather than undressing.

Lucinda Rosenfeld, a novelist and essayist, is the author of five books, including \u201cClass.\u201d When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. AMBITION MONSTER: A Memoir, by Jennifer Romolini This spring, the website LitHub published an essay about the lack of financial particulars in contemporary fiction. That piece stayed in my head as I read Jennifer Romolini\u2019s spirited memoir about her transformation from an angry and self-destructive child of teen parents in working-class Philadelphia to a hard-charging fashion magazine editor and, later, a \u201cCorporate Barbie\u201d at a Fortune 500 tech company. Although a work of nonfiction, the memoir, \u201cAmbition Monster,\u201d is at its most original when it grapples with the monetary calculations and status anxiety of a heroine who, unlike many denizens of the 21st-century mediascape, has neither a trust fund nor an Ivy League pedigree to fall back on. Instead, pregnant, shotgun-married and a college dropout at age 21, the author seems poised to follow in the domestic footsteps of her mother. But a circuitous path leads her back to community college, then out of a stifling marriage. A collection of truly terrible boyfriends follows. Among them: a writer-musician who, unhappy about being broken up with, sends a photocopy of his middle finger, embellished with the words, \u201cI now look at you as only a receptacle to put sperm.\u201d At a summer publishing course in her late 20s, Romolini makes the acquaintance of another world-class jerk: this one a \u201cmaverick\u201d middle-aged publisher. Soon after, she washes up in New York City. There, she finds herself sharing his V.I.P. table at the nightclub Moomba, and, more generally, \u201csubmitting to sex not for pleasure but as an extension of my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, a gathering of useful information, a performance of independence, if not solely a means to numb out.\u201d It is ultimately through pavement pounding, not connections, that she lands her first editorial assistant job. But her ascent up the career ladder is slippery; after paying rent, Romolini has so little money left over that she resorts to making $3 rice and beans last two nights. Even after landing a proper editor\u2019s post, she discovers that she makes less than she did while waiting tables. Compelled to seek side gigs, she writes unlikely-to-win-a-Pulitzer features for Target\u2019s in-house magazine with headlines like, \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Faucet Style?\u201d Insecurities about her skill set and class background persist, exacerbated by the frequent experience of dating men with more success and fancier educations than her own.

  "2025-04-26_953464_1": "What to Watch Anatomy of a Scene The director Blitz Bazawule narrates a scene from the musical, featuring the star performing as the dynamo Shug Avery. transcript \u201cMy name is Blitz Bazawule. And I\u2019m the director of \u2018The Color Purple.\u2019\u201d [SNAPPING] \u201cSo, this scene is where Shug Avery, played by the incredible Taraji P. Henson, performs at the juke joint for the very first time. Her character\u2019s enigmatic. We\u2019ve been hearing about her throughout. And we haven\u2019t seen her perform yet. And so, Dan Laustsen my DP, and I, knew that this was a moment that would have to register in the audience\u2019s mind as a moment of coming out, of sorts. My production designer, Paul Austerberry also really suggested that we do this practically and not on stage. And so, we found a swamp that we had to drain. It takes two months to drain out and two months to fill back up. But we drained it out to build the actual juke joint. And so, what you\u2019re seeing is Shug actually performing in a juke joint on location. And what was special about this was, also, it gave my choreographer, the incredible Fatima Robinson, the opportunity to really shine. And it took us about two weeks of rehearsals to figure out just the blocking for this. A lot was going to be going on. A lot of storytelling was going to be happening. And a lot of bodies were going to be moving in this space.\u201d \u201c(SINGING) Push the button.\u201d \u201c(SINGING) Push the button.\u201d \u201c(SINGING) Push the button.\u201d \u201cIt was very important that the blocking was right. It was also very important that we gave Taraji an opportunity to shine in this moment. She actually sung the song herself. She\u2019s not dubbed. This is actually her voice. She took vocal lessons to make sure she got this one right. And it was incredible because it was all believable for her in the space, performing this song in real time. This is where it gets special, when the lights go out. And we find ourselves in darkness. Now, for me, this is a moment that also allows the dance break to be a special moment. The song is a bit long. So, we knew that we didn\u2019t want the audiences just sitting through a redundant setup. So, I remember coming in to set one day much earlier. And the lights were \u2014 the environmental lights were on. And the blue light started to bleed through. I said to myself, I think that\u2019s it. If we can go from light to darkness this way. I think we could have something special.\u201d \u201cOoh, it ain\u2019t over yet, y\u2019all.\u201d \u201cNow, ladies.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI need you to work a little harder, O.K.?\u201d \u201cThe other thing that was special about this moment is the ending, when we find out that Shug Avery has actually chosen Celie and not Mister. So, there was a lot of storytelling. Even though it\u2019s a big dance number, there\u2019s still a lot of storytelling going on. So, by the time we find out that she\u2019s kind of made this choice, it\u2019s too late for Mister. Mister has been waiting. He\u2019s spent all this time, expecting that Shug Avery would come to him at the end of this performance. And he would be the beneficiary of all of this amazingness that\u2019s happened. And somehow, she kind of just sneaks past him and goes to Celie. And that\u2019s a big emotional and romantic moment in this film. And I think that it was really special. And I love the look on Colman\u2019s face when the realization hits him.

Lauren Martinez was well prepared for a birthday party in her backyard in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She set out a tray of deviled eggs next to syringes filled with confetti; there were Eggo waffles, egg salad sandwiches, a quiche and onion dip with roe. There was also a bag of mini chocolate eggs and a tray of cupcakes, each decorated with white and yellow frosting in the shape of a fried egg.

  "2025-04-26_845333_1": "Supported by The sale price of 135 West 50th Street in Midtown, which is only 35 percent full, was a sign of how much the pandemic upended the market for office buildings in New York City. In 2006, the hulking office building at 135 West 50th Street in Midtown Manhattan sold for $332 million. Tenants occupied nearly every floor; offices were in demand; real estate was booming. On Wednesday, it changed hands again, in an unusual online auction \u2014 for $8.5 million. The staggeringly low sale price of the 23-story glass behemoth that was once the headquarters of Sports Illustrated is the latest and perhaps most surprising sign of how the pandemic has upended the state of office buildings in New York City, home to the largest central business district in the United States. Several large Manhattan office buildings have sold in recent years at steep discounts, some going for less than half of what the previous owners paid, in a market that has yet to hit rock bottom. But office developers and sales brokers in New York City said they could not recall another large Manhattan building like 135 West 50th that had been sold for so little. David Sturner, a developer whose father\u2019s firm owned the building before selling it in 2006, was stunned by the final price. The building, he said, \u201ccertainly wasn\u2019t the greatest asset we owned\u201d but was a \u201csolid\u201d property. \u201cWhat\u2019s shocking is how fast the valuations dropped now that we\u2019ve seemingly reached bottom, or close to it,\u201d he added. He said that the latest sale price reflected the new reality for Manhattan\u2019s office sector. With companies embracing hybrid and remote work, employees do not visit the office as much and most buildings are no longer considered safe investments, he said. Bob Knakal, a leading commercial sales broker in the city and founder of BK Real Estate Advisors, said \u201cnobody ever anticipated that what has happened in the office market was going to happen.\u201d In many ways, 135 West 50th represents the myriad nondescript office towers that line Manhattan\u2019s streets. Built in 1963, the building stretches about half a block and has been occupied by major companies like the New York Telephone Company (which later became Verizon) and Zales, the jewelry retailer. For decades, buildings like it have made up the backbone of Manhattan\u2019s booming office sector. But today, they have lost their appeal and their value. The building\u2019s longtime owner, an investment fund managed by UBS Realty Investors, had previously tried to sell it for under $50 million, but that deal fell through. So UBS Realty turned to a two-day, public online auction on Ten-X, a real estate auction site. The property was listed alongside suburban strip malls, motels and apartment buildings. On Wednesday morning, at the Ten-X offices in Irvine, Calif., 135 West 50th was just one among dozens of properties being auctioned and monitored in real time by auction agents. Floor-to-ceiling video screens ringed the space, splashed with images of the properties that are up for bidding. Rows of agents at computers were on phone or video calls with buyers and sellers. In the last few seconds of an auction, the bids usually come in a flurry. The auction for 135 West 50th opened earlier this week with a starting bid of $7.5 million. On Wednesday, with seconds left and only a single bid of $8.5 million, a gray box that read \u201creserve not met,\u201d referring to the seller\u2019s minimum price, suddenly turned green and changed to \u201creserve met\u201d after that price was lowered. According to Ten-X, the reserve price is generally set at around three times the starting price. As the clock ticked down to zero, the auction was extended \u2014 three times \u2014 for a total of 10 minutes and 30 seconds. The auction finally ended with a sale price that was about 2.5 percent of what the sellers had paid for it. UBS Realty Investors declined to comment for this article. The identity of the new owner will be announced after the sale officially closes, which could take about 45 days. The buyer faces an immediate financial challenge: The auction was for the building itself, not the land. That is owned by a publicly traded real estate firm, which collects a monthly lease. But the rent from the building\u2019s current tenants is not enough to cover those monthly payments, which are set to increase every five years and do not expire until 2123. 135 West 50th has more than 920,000 square feet but is just 35 percent occupied with office tenants, down from about 40 percent a year ago. It is one of the least occupied large buildings in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge risk,\u201d Mr. Knakal said, adding that the new owner might have to renovate and upgrade swaths of the building, at a cost of about $200 to $300 per square foot, to attract new tenants. The new owner could also opt to convert 135 West 50th into residences or bulldoze it altogether to build something new. But each choice is challenging or expensive. Razing the building and constructing an entirely new one would cost, at least, hundreds of millions of dollars. While elected officials have encouraged developers to transform many older Manhattan office buildings into apartments or condominiums, very few transformations have moved forward, largely because of the high cost. Likewise, a large-scale change at 135 West 50th Street might be unlikely. Mr. Sturner pointed to multiple issues that limited the building\u2019s potential for conversion into residences: 10-foot-tall ceilings, which are short by today\u2019s standards; large, inconsistently placed columns; inadequate light from its mid-block location; and existing office tenants scattered throughout the building who would need to be relocated to free up contiguous space. 135 West 50th rose in the early 1960s during an office construction boom that reshaped Manhattan\u2019s skyline and economy. Designed by one of the architects of the original World Trade Center, the building opened in the heart of Midtown between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, replacing the palatial Roxy Theater, once the largest cinema in the world. It stretches 23 stories tall with an aluminum-and-glass facade. Over the years, it has housed accounting groups, law firms and many employees of Time Inc., which leased several floors there because of its proximity to the former Time & Life Building on Sixth Avenue. But in recent years, companies have an excess of available offices to choose from, and 135 West 50th Street has many downsides, including its dated interiors, despite some recent lobby and elevator upgrades. It is also relatively far from major commuter hubs like Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal, and faces the middle of a block on West 50th Street rather than a more convenient avenue. About 15 years ago, Sheryl Hilliard Tucker, a former editor at Time Inc., toured the building when she was overseeing Money magazine and looking for new offices. Almost immediately, she said, she felt that the space lacked the right vibe for editors and writers. \u201cMy first impression was, Oh, my goodness, we have moved back to the 1950s in an insurance building in the Midwest,\u201d Ms. Tucker said.

  "2025-04-26_777036_1": "Supported by 5 favorite places The writer and director, famous for making theatergoers squirm in their seats, says he feels most at home wherever the outsiders gather in his native city. The 1998 John Waters film \u201cPecker\u201d ends with an unlikely crowd carousing in a seedy basement bar/impromptu photo gallery in Baltimore. Strippers and one busty, enthusiastic art collector dance on tables as a talking Virgin Mary icon watches. It\u2019s a jubilant, chaotic and naughty party open to anyone with a sense of humor, just the way the director likes it. Mr. Waters, 78, gained a cult following in the 1970s with delightfully shocking films like \u201cMultiple Maniacs,\u201d \u201cFemale Trouble\u201d and, of course, the raunchy \u201cPink Flamingos\u201d before breaking big with \u201cHairspray,\u201d in 1988. Since then, Mr. Waters has built an empire of camp, now comprising more than a dozen films, spoken-word shows and numerous books, including his 2022 debut novel, \u201cLiarmouth,\u201d which has been optioned for a movie that Mr. Waters hopes will star Aubrey Plaza. Mr. Waters, a Baltimore native, grew up in Lutherville, Md., a suburb he described in a recent phone interview as \u201cupper-middle-class everything.\u201d Yearning for escape, he had his mom drop him off at a Baltimore beatnik hangout called Martick\u2019s, even though he was underage. \u201cShe said, \u2018Maybe you\u2019ll meet your people here,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI did find my people \u2014 bohemia!\u201d he said. Since those days, Mr. Waters has become an unofficial spokesman for all things Baltimore, which was one of The New York Times\u2019s 52 Places to Go in 2024. The city has embraced him, too. It honored him with an official day, Feb. 7, 1985 (it was a one-off), and the all-gender restrooms at the Baltimore Museum of Art, the institution to which he has bequeathed his sizable art collection, are named for him. Though Mr. Waters has apartments in San Francisco and New York and spends summers in Provincetown, Mass., he lives primarily in North Baltimore and has no plans to change that. \u201cIf I had to give up everywhere,\u201d Mr. Waters said, \u201cthis is where I\u2019d live.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

It also comes days after the Biden administration\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, held talks with senior Chinese leaders in Beijing and raised America\u2019s defense treaty with the Philippines. The U.S. State Department said this weekend that it stood with its \u201cally\u201d and condemned China for \u201cdeliberately\u201d colliding with a Philippine Coast Guard vessel. \u201cThis is the latest in a series of dangerous and escalatory actions by the P.R.C.,\u201d a State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said in the statement, referring to the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201cThe P.R.C.\u2019s unlawful claims of \u2018territorial sovereignty\u2019 over ocean areas where no land territory exists, and its increasingly aggressive actions to enforce them, threaten the freedoms of navigation and overflight of all nations.\u201d Mr. Miller reaffirmed the 1951 United States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty, which requires America to come to the defense of the Philippines if it comes under armed attack. Sabina Shoal, referred to as Xianbin Jiao by China and as Escoda Shoal by the Philippines, is the latest flashpoint in a continuing dispute between Beijing and Manila over territory in the South China Sea. In June, a Filipino sailor lost a thumb after a collision with a Chinese Coast Guard ship at the nearby Second Thomas Shoal, where Beijing has tried to thwart the resupply of a Philippine military outpost.

  "2025-04-26_855656_1": "What to Read Supported by Fiction Scott Preston\u2019s debut novel, \u201cThe Borrowed Hills,\u201d unfolds during the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain. Colin Barrett is the author of the story collections \u201cYoung Skins\u201d and \u201cHomesickness\u201d and of the novel \u201cWild Houses.\u201d When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE BORROWED HILLS, by Scott Preston Scott Preston\u2019s debut novel, \u201cThe Borrowed Hills,\u201d begins in the north of England during the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001, when several million British farm animals were slaughtered to contain the deadly virus. Steve Elliman, a truck driver, has returned to his father\u2019s sheep farm in the hilly, rainy, boulder-strewn region of Cumbria, also known as the fells. The Ellimans are tenant farmers, unlike their more successful neighbor, William Herne, who owns the land on which he grazes his much larger flock. As foot-and-mouth spreads, both farms face the same fate: In an arrestingly grim and gory sequence early in the book, the police \u2014 \u201csquaddies\u201d \u2014 show up to ensure the extermination of every last sheep. \u201cRifle muzzles placed between their ears and the bullets lined along their backs, so each bang stayed inside their heads,\u201d Preston writes. Afterward, Steve returns to the road for several years until the death of his father brings him back to the fells. With his family\u2019s tenancy dissolved, he winds up on the Herne farm, assisting his onetime competitor in the grueling maintenance of his new flock in exchange for room and board. A fugitive splinter of resentment worries Steve\u2019s heart; the foot-and-mouth outbreak originated on the Herne farm, and Steve believes that William owes him something. How much is an open question. On top of that, William is married to Helen, who was Steve\u2019s adolescent crush. Then there is the Hernes\u2019 teenage son, Danny, spooked to the margins of the homestead by Steve\u2019s arrival. The first third of \u201cThe Borrowed Hills\u201d unfolds with a pleasurable, slow-burn assurance. An Oedipally inflected saga of intergenerational retribution seems to be unfolding, bound by the slipknot logic of Greek tragedy: The closer Steve gets to what he wants, the closer he is to destroying it. The more William tries to evade his fate, the larger it looms. Then Preston changes focus and genre. The middle section of the book is taken over by Colin Tinley, a vicious poacher and freelance criminal who moves his crew of cartoonishly one-dimensional henchmen onto the Herne farm. Preston struggles to convince the reader that a man as shrewd and wary of \u201coffcomers,\u201d or outsiders, as Herne would fall so precipitously under the sway of the violent, unpredictable and manifestly untrustworthy Colin. But he does, dragging Steve with him into Colin\u2019s bloody scheming. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.  Enjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.

  "2025-04-26_578444_1": "A dogged paleoecologist named Dorothy Peteet is digging through the salt marshes of New York in the hope of preserving the city\u2019s best natural defense against climate change. On the edge of Queens, near Kennedy Airport, what remains of the salt marshes of Jamaica Bay.Credit...Amir Hamja/The New York Times Supported by One moment, Dorothy Peteet stood on a mat of squishy grass in Idlewild marsh, on the edge of Jamaica Bay in southern Queens. The next moment she sank to her hips in the cool, sulfuric muck. She was neither grossed out nor surprised. \u201cYes, this happens,\u201d Dr. Peteet, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on marshes, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I remembered to bring any towels.\u201d A saltwater marsh is an in-between place. Twice a day, it\u2019s flooded by the tide. When the tide is low, a marsh may appear to be solid grassy ground, but under the cordgrass it is riven with creeks and rivulets, mud snails, diamondback terrapins and fiddler crabs. For centuries, New Yorkers viewed Jamaica Bay\u2019s swamps as smelly barriers to progress, fit to become garbage dumps only when they couldn\u2019t be drained and paved into highways and airports. In recent decades, scientists like Dr. Peteet have recast the marshes as environmental marvels, providing a rare habitat for thousands of species, filtering the water and preventing contamination by locking tons of industrial pollutants away in their soggy underground vaults. Most important, Jamaica Bay\u2019s marshes serve as New York City\u2019s best defense against climate change, said Dr. Peteet, a paleoecology researcher at NASA and a professor at Columbia University. As the oceans warm and storms grow more violent, the marshes act like a cushion, absorbing energy from big waves before they crash into people\u2019s homes and threaten to suck whole neighborhoods into the sea.

  "2025-04-26_104875_1": "What to Read Essay Nearly 2,400 years ago, Plato worried that stories could corrupt susceptible minds. Moral panics over fiction have been common ever since. For Plato, storytelling was a license for bad behavior.Credit...Ricardo Tom\u00e1s; Photos, via Getty Images Supported by Lyta Gold is an essayist and fiction writer, and the author of \u201cDangerous Fictions: The Fear of Fantasy and the Invention of Reality,\u201d which will be published in October and from which this essay is adapted. The fear of fiction waxes and wanes, spiking every couple of decades like some kind of hysterical cicada. The current wave of book bans may be the worst since the 1980s, but we\u2019ve seen this sort of thing before, and we\u2019ll see it again. The \u201980s bans were driven by religious conservatives, dovetailing with the \u201csatanic panic\u201d over books and games involving magic, such as Dungeons & Dragons. Before that, in the 1950s, anxiety centered on trashy paperback novels and comics, which were said to cause \u201cmoral damage\u201d and a \u201closs of ideals\u201d in young people that would invariably lead to a life of crime. In the 1920s and early 1930s, the culprits were sexy Hollywood movies and modernist novels such as \u201cUlysses,\u201d which \u2014 lest people engage in too much sex and modernism \u2014 resulted in the Hays Code and more book bans. Earlier still, at the turn of the 20th century, people blamed America\u2019s problems on dirty books and images that could be ordered through the mail. In the centuries before that, there were bouts of concern over penny dreadfuls, women\u2019s novels, chivalric romances and comedic plays, going back through the ages to the fourth century B.C., when Plato declared in \u201cThe Republic\u201d that all stories and other artistic \u201cimitations\u201d of reality \u2014 including poetry, music and painting \u2014 were unacceptable in an ideal society unless they could be proved to impart rational, wholesome values. While the context changes, fear of fiction seems always to boil down to fear of one\u2019s society and the people who live in it. Other people\u2019s minds are frightening because they are inaccessible to us; one way we can know them is through their representations in fiction. We know that fiction affects us profoundly and mysteriously, and that other people are affected just as strongly and unpredictably as we are. Which means it\u2019s at least theoretically possible that art could seduce our fellow citizens into wicked beliefs. Moral panics over fiction are common in democracies, because the inner lives and motives of others matter a great deal in a democracy, arguably more so than in other political systems where people have less direct control over their social experience \u2014 and less freedom of expression. In a democracy, your fellow citizens can organize for social progress or encourage the passage of draconian laws that terrorize minorities. Fear of other people, and how they might work together to shift reality, is the reason the contest over written language so often extends to the realm of make-believe \u2014 of fiction. Fiction is the story of other people; this is what makes it dangerous. Most histories of dangerous fiction begin with Plato, though anxiety about the pernicious effect of stories can be found in fragments of work by earlier Greek philosophers, who criticized the epic poetry of their day for portraying the gods as murderous, adulterous jerks. In \u201cThe Republic,\u201d Plato expands on these early concerns: When people encounter stories about gods and heroes behaving badly, what stops them from imitating what they hear? When the poets sing about Achilles mourning Patroclus, won\u2019t the audience think it\u2019s OK to cry over dead loved ones, like a woman? When Achilles looks Agamemnon in the face and calls him a \u201cwinebibber, with the eyes of a dog and the heart of a deer\u201d \u2014 I mean, what if you said that to your dad? A cop? The president? Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.  Enjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.

His latest novel, \u201cGodwin,\u201d is about an adrift hero searching for a soccer superstar. Many writers have \u201cobsessions that emerge as our subject matter, whether we like it or not,\u201d Joseph O\u2019Neill says. \u201cI\u2019m stuck with sports.\u201dCredit...Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Supported by The novelist Joseph O\u2019Neill has a good idea of his daughter\u2019s earliest memories: being driven through the northern swath of Benin in a jeep, in hot pursuit of a (fictional) story her father himself was only beginning to understand. This is remote terrain, even for visitors who aren\u2019t American toddlers on their first trip to West Africa. This was in 2015, part of an essential literary reconnaissance mission for O\u2019Neill, who was at work on a sprawling tale of an adrift but brilliant man, an athletic prodigy and the fallibility of human consensus. O\u2019Neill is accustomed to working on a large canvas, writing books that crisscross the world and follow intelligent, sensitive, occasionally self-lacerating men in exile. The resulting novel, \u201cGodwin,\u201d which Pantheon will publish on Tuesday, centers on Mark Wolfe, a roguish and capable (if underperforming) technical writer in Pittsburgh who belongs to a writing cooperative and appears to be suffering a \u201ccrisis of dignity.\u201d When his half brother, an aspiring soccer talent scout in England, calls with an enigmatic prospect \u2014 the promise of signing Africa\u2019s answer to Lionel Messi \u2014 Mark embarks on an adventure that will change the course of his life. Braided in with Mark\u2019s plight is a workplace drama, full of bureaucratic back-stabbing and passive-aggressive emails of a sort that will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever attended a city council meeting or watched public access TV. The stakes of both stories \u2014 a one-in-a-million shot at celebrity for a young athlete, the elusive promise of professional harmony \u2014 are equally high, and ratchet up as the plotlines inevitably dovetail by the novel\u2019s end.

Exit Interview Melanie La Barrie, who brought the role of Ang\u00e9lique from the West End to Broadway, flew back on New Year\u2019s Eve with \u201cHadestown\u201d on the horizon. Melanie La Barrie, who finished up her run as Ang\u00e9lique in \u201c& Juliet\u201d at the Stephen Sondheim Theater on Saturday.Credit...Emily Soto for The New York Times Melanie La Barrie thought she would make it through her last performance of \u201c& Juliet\u201d without succumbing to tears. She was mistaken \u2014 though contributing factors include that it was the end of a nine-show holiday week; that she originated the role of Ang\u00e9lique, Juliet\u2019s nurse, in this British jukebox-musical riff on \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d in 2019; and that she made her Broadway debut in it, at 48, in October 2022. On Saturday night at the Stephen Sondheim Theater, where \u201c& Juliet\u201d is one of Broadway\u2019s poppiest hits, La Barrie sailed through her comic Act I duet with Paulo Szot, who plays Ang\u00e9lique\u2019s long-lost love. But her poignant Act II solo, sung to Juliet (Lorna Courtney), undid her. Embracing Courtney at the finish, La Barrie kept her eyes shut tight against the audience\u2019s ovation, needing to stay rooted in the show.

Credit...Tim Lahan Supported by When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. GODWIN, by Joseph O\u2019Neill It\u2019s possible that you have encountered someone like Mark Wolfe, a restive 40-something in Pittsburgh who has, in his own words, \u201cnot fully recovered from a decade spent as an active member of the American intelligentsia.\u201d Maybe you\u2019ve worked with this guy, slept with him, sparred with him on social media. See the full list here, and keep track of how many you\u2019ve read or want to read. It\u2019s also possible that reading Mark\u2019s alternately diffident and combative first-person narration in \u201cGodwin,\u201d Joseph O\u2019Neill\u2019s sharp and slippery new novel, will provoke a more intimate tremor of recognition, especially when he describes the intellectual milieu that formed him: Everyone was disdained, oneself especially. The performance of kicking in one\u2019s own rotten ideological floorboards was something we called \u201creflexivity.\u201d This was a cop-out, of course, but it was a smart cop-out. Being smart \u2014 which we confused with being knowledgeable \u2014 was less about seeing something for what it was than about critically viewing one\u2019s act of seeing, and then critically viewing oneself critically viewing one\u2019s originally seeing self, and so on infinitely, as in an Escher, without vertigo. Ouch. But let\u2019s keep things fictional. Mark reminded me of one of Ben Lerner\u2019s prickly alter egos. And of the angry, nameless protagonist of Jonathan Dee\u2019s \u201cSugar Street.\u201d Also of Tony Gallo, the radical aspiring journalist in Eleanor Catton\u2019s \u201cBirnam Wood.\u201d For all his professed leftist principles, for all his shamefaced awareness of the privilege his white, cisgender heterosexual maleness confers, Mark \u2014 like those other dudes \u2014 can\u2019t quite shake his entitlement to being the center of attention, the smartest person in the room, the main character. But is he? Mark shares narratorial duties with Lakesha Williams, his colleague at a cooperative for freelance technical writers. Lakesha is a founder of the Group (as it\u2019s called) and one of its leaders. She speaks first in \u201cGodwin,\u201d and also gets the last word. Mark, a marginal, intermittently productive, somewhat problematic Group member, takes up more space in the book, partly because his blustery temperament drowns out Lakesha\u2019s rigorous circumspection. His theory talk trumps her buttoned-up H.R. jargon. \u201cWhat I saw, when I looked at Wolfe,\u201d Lakesha says, using his possibly metaphorical surname, \u201cwas a member with output issues.\u201d She also surmises that he is \u201csuffering from a crisis of dignity,\u201d which may be a more succinct summary of his condition than his many pages of globe-trotting and navel-gazing. To Lakesha, Mark is an ambiguous figure in a dark workplace comedy that escalates into a farce of organizational toxicity. Her portion of \u201cGodwin\u201d mostly chronicles the unraveling of the Group and the testing of her own idealism, as turf battles and procedural squabbles turn into a nasty power struggle waged in memos and meetings. As a Black woman in a mostly white professional setting, she suffers her own crisis of dignity, undermined by colleagues she can\u2019t quite bring herself to accuse of racism.

Credit...Naomi Anderson-Subryan Supported by In 2022, organics accounted for 15 percent of all fruit and vegetable sales in the United States despite being far pricier than conventional produce. But with today\u2019s high grocery bills, even some committed organic shoppers are agonizing over which blueberries to buy and wondering: Is organic really worth the cost? Here are some facts to help you figure out what\u2019s right for you and your budget. Unlike the terms \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201csustainable,\u201d the Department of Agriculture\u2019s organic seal is highly regulated (though not entirely fraud-proof). When you see the USDA Organic sticker on a banana, you can generally assume it has been grown without the use of synthetic fertilizers, genetically modified organisms and most synthetic pesticides. Its production may have involved organic farming techniques, such as rotating crops and planting cover crops, too. It\u2019s worth noting that not all organic farmers have the time, money or desire to pursue official certification. You can always ask at a farmers market how the food was grown. At first glance, organic farming seems like a clear climate win because it doesn\u2019t use synthetic fertilizers, which require lots of energy, and thus lots of fossil fuels, to produce.

THE CLIFFS, by J. Courtney Sullivan An abandoned house painted purple sits on a promontory overlooking the sea in Awadapquit, Maine. As mysterious houses in fiction often do, it takes on the importance of a central character in J. Courtney Sullivan\u2019s capacious and engaging sixth novel, \u201cThe Cliffs.\u201d Jane Flanagan first spots the house from the water, when she is a teenage tour guide on a lobster boat in the 1990s, earning money during a summer program. Instantly enchanted, Jane cuts her classes in favor of reading the course books under the trees on the property. She explores the house\u2019s nooks and treasures \u2014 including a plaque dated 1846 that names the original owner as Capt. Samuel Littleton \u2014 with her best friend, Allison, whose family of innkeepers provide Jane with warmth she doesn\u2019t get at home. Jane then forgets the purple house for over a decade as she moves away from Awadapquit for college, grad school and a career as a women\u2019s studies archivist at the Schlesinger Library in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cThroughout her 20s, she occasionally went on dates, most of them bad and made bearable only by copious amounts of alcohol.\u201d It\u2019s not until she\u2019s 30 and bringing home her boyfriend, David, to introduce him to her family, that she revisits the purple house. All seems promising as the couple \u201cwalked to the edge of the cliff, hand in hand, pretending the property was theirs\u201d; but \u201ca fear tugged at Jane\u2019s pocket, whispering that she had only wandered temporarily into somebody else\u2019s lovely life.\u201d Jane returns to Boston with David, but the house isn\u2019t done with her. Ten years later, an alcohol-related incident has created chaos in both her career and her relationship. Her mother\u2019s death creates an excuse for her to escape to Awadapquit, where she works on cleaning out the family home. Soon the purple house beckons her again when she is hired by Genevieve, the present owner, to discover its history over the centuries, and the possible identity of the ghost appearing to Genevieve\u2019s young son. Jane\u2019s research is a portal that opens up the novel to aspects of Maine life that are not on the typical tourist trail.

But she is not done yet: She has three more chances to win medals in Paris. Reporting from Paris Three years after withdrawing from the team final of the Tokyo Olympics because of a mental block, a move that prompted critics to call her a loser, a quitter and un-American, Simone Biles on Thursday proved to the world \u2014 and to herself \u2014 that she was unstoppable. Wearing a leotard reminiscent of Wonder Woman\u2019s suit, Biles, 27, won the all-around title at the Paris Games, becoming the oldest all-around champion since 1952 and only the third woman \u2014 and the first since 1968 \u2014 to win two Olympic all-around titles. The gold was Biles\u2019s ninth Olympic medal, pushing her record total of Olympic and world championship medals to 39 and reaffirming her standing as one of the best athletes of all time. After Biles learned that she had won, she waved to a crowd that chanted \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d and then walked off the raised platform, rested her elbows nearby and exhaled. \u201cAll in all, I\u2019m super proud of my performance tonight and the fight that I had for the last three years, mentally and physically, just to get back competing on a world stage, Olympic Games,\u201d said Biles, who also won the gold in the all-around at the 2016 Rio Games. Except for an uncharacteristic mistake on the uneven bars, Biles nailed her routines and did so under extraordinary pressure, as Rebeca Andrade of Brazil was having a fantastic night. Andrade, the silver medalist in the all-around in Tokyo, had led the competition after the second of four events. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Lucy Yu in her Manhattan bookstore in August, weeks after a fire destroyed it.Credit... Supported by Photographs by Hiroko Masuike Jordyn Holman and Hiroko Masuike followed the owner of Yu & Me and her colleagues as they rebuilt the store. Lucy Yu wasn\u2019t sure if she had smoke in her lungs or was having an anxiety attack. She needed fresh air. Five days earlier, on the Fourth of July, she had raced out of her bookstore in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown as it filled with smoke. A fire had broken out in an upstairs apartment, threatening to destroy all she had built. Now Ms. Yu was back, and had to face it. She had assembled a team of friends to pack up the books that weren\u2019t damaged beyond repair and put them in storage. By the last bag, she had pain in her chest. She walked outside and sat down on a stoop next door, as her friends comforted her and brought her water. Her once-vibrant store, Yu & Me Books, needed a gut renovation to remove mold and smoke residue. The ceiling was caving in, the furniture she had built was damaged, and the speaker system she had installed was shot. A single bulb hung, emitting light; she and her friends had to use flashlights in the basement. They had salvaged a few thousand books, but more than 1,400 were ruined.

  "2025-04-26_486383_1": "Supported by David French Opinion Columnist What is the most important single thing that you can do to heal our national divides and to improve the social and economic mobility of your struggling neighbors? I\u2019d submit that it\u2019s not voting for the right candidate (though you should certainly do that), nor is it engaging in activism to raise visibility for a worthy cause (though I endorse that as well). Instead, it\u2019s something that is at once much simpler but also much more difficult. Make a new friend. The story of modern America \u2014 especially for working-class Americans who did not go to college \u2014 is a story of declining connections, declining friendships and a loss of a sense of belonging. That sense of isolation makes people miserable, and as the misery spreads, it affects our economy and our culture. The data, quite frankly, is horrifying. Last month, the American Enterprise Institute released its 2024 American Social Capital Survey. It exposes a stark social divide. People with high school diplomas or less spend less time in public spaces, less time in hobby groups and less time in community groups or in sports leagues than those with college degrees and higher (for simplicity, I\u2019ll refer to the two groups as high school graduates and college graduates). And they\u2019re less likely to host friends, family and neighbors in their homes. Let\u2019s pause here for a moment. Think about the consequences of this distinction: Tens of millions of working-class Americans experience a social reality different from that of their more educated peers. The lack of common spaces and common experiences means that isolation can become self-perpetuating. The friendship numbers are just as sobering. Americans of all stripes are reporting that they have declining numbers of friends, but the decline is most pronounced among high school graduates. Between 1990 and 2024, the percentage of college graduates who reported having zero close friends rose to 10 percent from 2 percent, which is upsetting enough. Among high school graduates, the percentage rose to a heartbreaking 24 percent from 3 percent. The news just keeps getting worse. In 1990, an impressive 49 percent of high school graduates reported having at least six close friends. By 2024, that percentage had been cut by more than half \u2014 to 17 percent. The percentage of college graduates with that many friends declined also, but only to 33 percent from 45 percent. The disappearance of friendship has profound consequences. According to the A.E.I. report, there is a class divide in the percentage of Americans who can rely on someone to give them a ride to the doctor, lend them a small amount of money in an emergency or offer a place to stay. Another way of putting this is that the Americans who are most vulnerable to losing the informal social safety net of friends and relatives may be the people who need it the most. It should be no surprise, then, that Americans at lower income levels report a far lower sense of belonging than those who are more prosperous. The Center for Inclusion and Belonging at the American Immigration Council, an immigration advocacy group, and Over Zero, an organization that studies and seeks to prevent identity-group-based violence, have created a comprehensive Belonging Barometer that measures the extent to which Americans feel a sense of belonging in their families, among their friends and in their workplaces, their communities and the nation as a whole. In every category, those with fewer resources reported less belonging. We should care deeply about these numbers regardless of any larger social or cultural impact they might have. The thought that so many millions of our fellow citizens feel as if they don\u2019t belong, as if they can\u2019t call anyone for help or simply lack the pure joy of fellowship with close friends should grieve us all. It should change the way we behave. It should make us be more intentional about reaching out to people. And it should call us to action in our own neighborhoods and communities. Know someone who would want to read this? Share the column. But declining friendship isn\u2019t just a matter of individual pain. It\u2019s also a matter of national concern. I recently read an intriguing paper by N.Y.U.\u2019s Jay Frankel that makes the argument that \u201cemotional abandonment, both in individual lives and on a mass scale, is typically felt as humiliating; and it undermines the sense that life is meaningful and valuable.\u201d One might think that isolation leads to the quiet desperation that Henry David Thoreau observed in his time, but for many people it triggers a much more aggressive response \u2014 including a pull toward authoritarianism. In 2021, in an essay in The Washington Post, Michael Bender wrote about his experience embedded with Donald Trump\u2019s most loyal fans, the \u201cFront Row Joes\u201d who traveled from rally to rally across America to support the politician they loved best. Following Trump, Bender writes, had \u201cmade their lives richer.\u201d They came for Trump, but they stayed for the relationships. Trump\u2019s rallies \u201cgave the Joes a reason to travel the country, staying at one another\u2019s homes, sharing hotel rooms and car-pooling. Two had married \u2014 and later divorced \u2014 by Trump\u2019s second year in office.\u201d If you wonder why the Trump fever won\u2019t break, consider the extent to which the movement transcends politics. \u201cIn Trump,\u201d Bender notes, \u201cthey\u2019d found someone whose endless thirst for a fight encouraged them to speak up for themselves, not just in politics but also in relationships and at work.\u201d Loneliness doesn\u2019t just have an impact on politics; it also has an impact on social mobility. A 2022 report from Opportunity Insights that analyzed data from 70.3 million users of Facebook found that \u201cat the community level, cross-class connections boost social mobility more than anything else.\u201d This is extraordinary, but it also squares with common sense. I grew up in a small town in Kentucky, and it was only after I made friends with people who had greater resources and experiences in the world that I began to expand my own horizons. I\u2019ve tried my best to do the same, to use my own resources and experiences to lift up friends in my life. Last week a friend of mine shared an extraordinary article by Rachel Cohen, a young policy correspondent at Vox. Cohen writes that her generation was taught that \u201creal social change would come only from mass protest and collective pressure on governments and corporations.\u201d In this construct, \u201cVolunteering, donating, and modifying one\u2019s personal behavior were, at best, unproductive; at worst, they were harmful distractions from the change we really need.\u201d Cohen wonders whether this emphasis on systems and mass protest is actually contributing to loneliness and friendlessness. Her answer is to go local, to volunteer. That doesn\u2019t mean neglecting your interest in systemic change, but it does mean engaging with people personally and perhaps even forging enduring connections. Of course you can make friends in mass movements (as we see from the Front Row Joes), but there is often a tangible benefit to local engagement. You meet people who live close to you. There\u2019s an ease in creating and maintaining the relationship when there\u2019s physical proximity, and local engagement also means creating local spaces where people can feel at home. Ever since I started writing about American anxiety, polarization and fear, I\u2019ve gotten an immense amount of correspondence from people who are both worried about the state of the nation and worried about people they know personally \u2014 an old friend who\u2019s gone off the deep end or a family member who seems lost to conspiracy theories. Frequently they ask me for resources. They might ask for the best fact check I\u2019ve read to respond to an election conspiracy theory. Or they might ask if there\u2019s a good book they can send to change a friend\u2019s mind. I\u2019ve started responding to their questions with a question of my own: How much time do you spend with them? Millions of Americans are lonely. They feel sad, mad and stuck. They\u2019re alienated from their communities and angry at their predicament, and they don\u2019t feel that they have many options to improve their lives. But friendship can help fix each of those problems. With fellowship comes joy. With connection comes opportunity. There are few higher and better callings than to forge a bond with a person and provide a place where they belong. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

EMPIRE\u2019S SON, EMPIRE\u2019S ORPHAN: The Fantastical Lives of Ikbal and Idries Shah, by Nile Green \u201cThe East is a career,\u201d Benjamin Disraeli wrote in his 1847 novel \u201cTancred,\u201d two decades before he became the prime minister of the United Kingdom. The dictum rang true for generations of colonial officers and swashbuckling scholars, from Richard Francis Burton to Lawrence of Arabia. During the sunset of the British Empire, it also rang true for a few entrepreneurial \u201cEasterners\u201d who got rich dispensing tidbits of eternal wisdom to Western readers convinced of their own culture\u2019s spiritual bankruptcy. By 1959, Khalil Gibran\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d had sold its millionth copy and V.S. Naipaul had published \u201cThe Mystic Masseur,\u201d a fond satire of the guru grifter. Nile Green\u2019s \u201cEmpire\u2019s Son, Empire\u2019s Orphan\u201d is a biography of Ikbal Shah and his son Idries, the more famous author of the countercultural best seller \u201cThe Sufis.\u201d Green shows how, by dint of hard work, brazen fraud and a mastery of \u201cthe occult energies of identity,\u201d over the course of the 20th century, first father and then son became recognized as experts on the East in general and Afghanistan in particular, helping to shape how those places were viewed on both sides of the Atlantic. In fact, it\u2019s doubtful that Ikbal or Idries ever set foot in Afghanistan, a country they both portrayed as a Shangri-La of noble warriors, wise mystics and fabled treasure. They had a familial link to the place, however: a 19th-century ancestor who had fought alongside the British during the First Anglo-Afghan War and was rewarded with an estate in the Raj. Ikbal Shah grew up on that estate, just north of Delhi, but was sent to Edinburgh to study medicine in 1913 (he never graduated). He married a Scotswoman and published a book of prose poems called \u201cEastern Moonbeams,\u201d leveraging his literary persona into a membership with the Royal Asiatic Society and publication in T.S. Eliot\u2019s magazine The New Criterion. He also inveigled his way into the outer circles of imperial policymaking, penning alarmist (and largely fictional) travelogues about Bolshevik encroachments into the high Hindu Kush.

  "2025-04-26_784127_1": "Middle East Tensions Supported by Mr. Deif has survived several previous Israeli assassination attempts and has been the No. 2 Hamas leader in Gaza. Israel said it killed him in a strike last month in southern Gaza. Reporting from Jerusalem The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had killed Muhammad Deif, the elusive commander of Hamas\u2019s military wing who has long been one of the country\u2019s most wanted militants. He was widely seen as one of the chief architects of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The announcement culminated weeks of speculation about the fate of Mr. Deif after an airstrike on July 13 on the outskirts of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, that targeted him. At the time, the Israeli military did not say for certain whether he had been killed. Hamas has not explicitly confirmed or denied Israel\u2019s claim on Thursday. \u201cFollowing an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Muhammad Deif was eliminated in the strike,\u201d the Israeli military statement said, without offering any more specific evidence that he was dead. At least 90 people on the ground in the vicinity of the strike were killed that day, according to the Gazan health ministry. Its tally does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but health officials said some were women and children. Mr. Deif, who survived several previous Israeli assassination attempts, has been the No. 2 Hamas leader inside Gaza. He is the highest-ranking Hamas figure inside Gaza that Israel says it has killed since Oct. 7. Israel\u2019s government made eliminating Hamas\u2019s leadership a stated goal of the war, and Mr. Deif\u2019s death would be counted as a victory in that effort. How Hamas\u2019s operations could be affected remains to be seen, though: Israel has killed many senior commanders in the past, only to see the group swiftly replace them.

Notes: Includes absentee ballots that have been accepted by each state. Not all returned absentee ballots are accepted.

Total number and share of ballots rejected Early voting surged in the 2020 presidential election, driving a massive increase in overall turnout and helping Joseph R. Biden Jr. secure his victory. Many states made early voting easier that year because of the pandemic, but over the last four years some states have passed laws that will make it harder for voters to cast ballots early in this election. The number of people who have requested absentee ballots in each state offers an indication of how strong the early turnout may be. Ballots requests as a percentage of voters, compared with total requests in 2020. Notes: Data is for ballots requested or sent, depending on the available data in each state. See the important deadlines for registering to vote, mailing ballots and voting early in person. The strength of early voting in this election will be important for the campaigns of both former President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2020, about 60 percent of Democrats and 32 percent of Republicans who voted did so by mail, according to a study by the M.I.T. Election Data and Science Lab. As a percentage of voters registered to a party Notes: Data is from states where ballots must be requested and party registration data is reported. Ballot requests are not the same as actual votes. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent false claims that mail-in voting is rife with fraud, Republicans have made efforts to encourage early voting in this election. In Pennsylvania, the party has pledged more than $10 million to persuade Republicans to vote by mail in November. But so far, the number of ballot requests made by registered Democrats in the state has far outpaced requests made by Republicans. Among the states that made changes to early voting rules since 2020 were Georgia and North Carolina, both important swing states. In Georgia, the Republican legislature and governor passed a sweeping law that decreased the time to request absentee ballots, imposed strict new ID requirements for those ballots and significantly limited the availability of absentee ballot drop boxes. North Carolina has added similar restrictions, and it sent absentee ballots to voters two weeks late this year after a court ordered the last-minute removal of Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s name from the ballots. Hurricane Helene created challenges for voters in the state as well, causing significant damage and accessibility issues at 10 early voting sites. This page will be regularly updated with the latest data on early voting in each state, and figures may change as new sources of information become available. * The number of voters in each state, except North Dakota and Wyoming, is based on L2\u2019s estimates of active registered voters in those states based on voting history. The number of voters in North Dakota and Wyoming are based on the voting-age population in those states.

  "2025-04-26_343931_1": "Campus Crackdown Claudine Gay faced backlash over the university\u2019s response to antisemitism on campus, which led to increased scrutiny of her academic record. Harvard\u2019s president, Claudine Gay, announced her resignation on Tuesday, after her presidency had become engulfed in crisis over accusations of plagiarism and what some called her insufficient response to antisemitism on campus after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. In announcing she would step down immediately, Dr. Gay, Harvard\u2019s first Black president and the second woman to lead the university, ended a turbulent tenure that began last July. She will have the shortest stint in office of any Harvard president since its founding in 1636. Alan M. Garber, an economist and physician who is Harvard\u2019s provost and chief academic officer, will serve as interim president. Dr. Gay will remain a tenured professor of government and African and African American studies. Dr. Gay became the second university president to resign in recent weeks, after she and the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. appeared in a Dec. 5 congressional hearing in which they appeared to evade the question of whether students who called for the genocide of Jews should be punished. Penn\u2019s president, M. Elizabeth Magill, resigned four days after that hearing. Sally Kornbluth, M.I.T.\u2019s president, has also faced calls for her resignation. In a letter announcing her decision, Dr. Gay said that after consulting with members of the university\u2019s governing body, the Harvard Corporation, \u201cit has become clear that it is in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge with a focus on the institution rather than any individual.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-26_944720_1": "Supported by Michelle Cottle Michelle Cottle writes about national politics for Opinion and is a host of the podcast \u201cMatter of Opinion.\u201d Rolling into the Labor Day weekend, Donald Trump was able to relax a little on Friday night with a ballroom of smitten women in downtown Washington. He began the week with a controversy over Arlington National Cemetery and ended the week with what smelled like a flip-flop on Florida\u2019s abortion referendum. Mr. Trump needs votes from women, and the Arlington and abortion story lines aren\u2019t exactly winners in that regard. So it was interesting to watch him working to firm up a part of his base, at the third annual convention of Moms for Liberty, a conservative group devoted to \u201cparental rights.\u201d He took a stab at addressing the Arlington mess, telling his cleaned-up version of events and whining about how persecuted he is. But mostly, he tried to offer what he thinks women want \u2014 Trump unfiltered. Which is, in his head, the ultimate winning strategy. No doubt, everyone was in a partying mood. Everywhere you looked, there were women rocking Trump T-shirts and cocktail dresses, cowboy boots and stilettos, ponytails and MAGA hats. But Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance raised the same question as his recent string of North Carolina rallies: If he\u2019s spending time in safe spaces and once-safe states, when will he start trying to win over on-the-fence women and others who may decide the election? Forgoing his usual rallies, the former president had agreed to a special \u201cfireside chat\u201d with Moms for Liberty. To signal how cozy and Oprah-esque this was going to be, a vase of red roses sat on a small table beside his large white armchair and the one occupied by Tiffany Justice, a co-founder of the group. Before the event, Ms. Justice shared with me her hopes for the encounter. She wanted Mr. Trump to talk parental rights, of course, but she also wanted folks to see a softer side of him: \u201cHe\u2019s a dad. He\u2019s a grandfather. He loves his family. We\u2019ve seen him working with his family in politics and business, right? I hope the American people get to know Donald Trump in a little bit of a different way. He\u2019ll get to express his love for his family. I think that\u2019s going to resonate with American voters.\u201d In theory, this was a brilliant opportunity for Team Trump, which is desperate to humanize the candidate and get him to talk policy rather than simply slag his political enemies. In practice, the evening kept veering off course precisely as you\u2019d expect. Ms. Justice pitched plenty of softballs. Asserting that it was \u201cobvious\u201d Mr. Trump loves \u201cbeing a father and grandfather,\u201d she invited him to share why he continues \u201dto choose to work with your children in business and politics.\u201d Great time to talk about legacy or family bonds or what a crackerjack attack dog Don Jr. is, right? Wrong! \u201cI\u2019ve always liked it. I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll be doing it very much politically,\u201d he says, noting how \u201cunfair\u201d it has been to the kids. Especially Ivanka. \u201cGreat student. Beautiful girl.\u201d But everyone was mean to her when she was in the White House. She even gave up her superprofitable women\u2019s wear line! And it\u2019s not as though she wanted to be the \u201cUnited Nations secretary\u201d or ambassador \u2014 which he said he wanted her to do. But according to him, she said, \u201cDaddy, I don\u2019t want to do that. I just want to help people get jobs.\u201d He rambled on about how she hired \u201cmillions of people during the course of her stay,\u201d before grumpily concluding, \u201cNothing ever good. It was just very tough.\u201d Ms. Justice also invited Mr. Trump to talk about his mother. \u201cShe was obviously a very strong woman. Was she hard on you with school?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t,\u201d said Mr. Trump. \u201cI had a great mother, a great father.\u201d \u201cVery different people,\u201d he added, but they had a \u201cgreat\u201d marriage that lasted more than 60 years. \u201cI said, Pop, I\u2019m not going to be able to beat you with that,\u201d he said, laughing. One might assume that at a Moms for Liberty love-in, Mr. Trump would at least pay extra attention to parental rights. One would be mistaken. Now, to be fair, that phrase has become a bloated term applied to pretty much anything that happens around a school that conservatives dislike, from vaccine mandates to discussions of race to a book about the sexuality of sea horses. One member from California told me she had so far gotten 20 books pulled from the schools in her district. But these days, trans issues are what really juice the faithful, and Mr. Trump nodded to that a few times. Asked about the power of the presidency to combat wokeness \u2014 \u201cWell, you can do everything!\u201d he crowed \u2014 he noted how \u201cincredible\u201d it is that \u201cyour kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation.\u201d Um, what? That said, he spent most of his time on the topic talking about Olympic athletes who had \u201ctransgendered\u201d \u2014 spending extra energy smearing that Algerian boxer, who does not, in fact, identify as trans. Details. Shmetails. At one point, Mr. Trump went on a disjointed reminiscence about the many presidential debates he had participated in, culminating with the infamous face-off with President Biden this past June. \u201cHow did he do? He was sharp as a tack,\u201d cracked the former president. Quick as a bunny, Ms. Justice jumped in to head off his extended mockery. Many Americans know the pain of watching \u201cas their family members have aged and experienced dementia,\u201d she observed, heaping praise on Mr. Trump for handling the awkward moment with \u201csuch grace.\u201d Clearly at a loss, Mr. Trump babbled that he had been \u201csurprised by a lot of things\u201d and recalled that he had looked at Mr. Biden \u201cfor a brief moment\u201d \u2014 which he hadn\u2019t wanted to do, mind you, because he\u2019s \u201cangry at him\u201d for doing such a \u201chorrible job.\u201d Then he was off and ranting about the awfulness of Kamala Harris and how unfair it is that, after spending so much time and money attacking Mr. Biden, he had to shift to her. \u201cTurned out she didn\u2019t work at McDonald\u2019s!\u201d he griped. (I\u2019ll let you look up that faux outrage yourself.) Now, Ms. Justice is no shrinking violet. During our talk, she dismissed and dodged any questions she disliked \u2014 such as her concerns about JD Vance\u2019s penchant for insulting women \u2014 or tried to divert us onto more comfortable ground. Asked about the gender gap in the presidential race, she claimed not to understand what I meant. Then, as I started to explain, she interrupted: \u201cSo you mean \u2018sex.\u2019 Because there\u2019s no such thing as gender,\u201d she quipped, looking to draw me into a back-and-forth on gender identity rather than Mr. Trump\u2019s lousy electoral track record with women. It will surprise no one that in Ms. Justice\u2019s t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Mr. Trump, the topic of abortion was avoided like \u2026 well, like the former president\u2019s mention of any of his kids not named Ivanka. Still, there was little Ms. Justice could do to keep Mr. Trump on track. Not that it mattered to anyone in the room. At evening\u2019s end, the crowd inching toward the escalators was buzzing, and I chatted with some women thrilled simply to have been in the same room with their idol. But as for the rest of America \u2014 all those women and men not already sold on the MAGA king \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine they saw much of anything different in his fireside chattiness.

  "2025-04-26_173823_1": "It\u2019s hydrating, to start. Here\u2019s what else experts had to say about this warm-weather treat \u2014 along with some refreshing recipes. Credit...Christopher Simpson for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews. Prop Stylist: Paige Hicks. Supported by Watermelon is the fruit of summer. In the United States, it\u2019s more popular than cantaloupe, honeydew and all other melons combined. It\u2019s good for your body, too, especially on a hot day. Here\u2019s a rundown of watermelon\u2019s healthiest qualities, plus some cool and delicious recipes from New York Times Cooking. \u201cWatermelon\u201d is a fitting name, because it\u2019s more than 91 percent water. When you eat an average-size wedge (10 ounces or so), you\u2019re effectively drinking a full cup of water. Hydration keeps the body functioning as it should, from promoting blood flow to bowel regularity. The water in watermelon helps keep you hydrated, which can be extra beneficial in hot weather, when you lose more fluids through sweat. \u201cOur bodies recognize and utilize water molecules regardless of the source,\u201d said Dr. Tamara Hew-Butler, a sports medicine scientist at Wayne State University. \u201cMoist foods like fruit, vegetables and soups are considered water sources.\u201d Older people, in particular, may find it easier and more enjoyable to get some of their fluids through fruit, said Amy Ellis, a dietitian and associate professor of nutrition at the University of Alabama. They tend to feel less thirsty and therefore drink less \u2014 one of the reasons they\u2019re at a higher risk for dehydration and heat-related illness during a heat wave. Because watermelon is mostly water, it\u2019s also low in calories \u2014 a one-cup serving has just 46. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s sky-high in sugar because it tastes so sweet, but really it\u2019s very moderate,\u201d Dr. Ellis said. One cup of diced watermelon contains about 9.5 grams of sugar, which is less than the 13 grams in a cup of chopped apples or the nearly 15 grams in a cup of blueberries. That\u2019s little enough that the fruit likely won\u2019t cause spikes in blood sugar, added Joanne Slavin, a dietitian and professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota. Calories are energy, though, so watermelon alone won\u2019t sufficiently fuel your body, said Samantha Dieras, a dietitian and the director of ambulatory nutrition services at Mount Sinai Hospital. But when you eat watermelon as part of a balanced diet, the water content and sweet flavor could help you feel satiated. Watermelon is fat- and sodium-free, which is good for your heart. But the jury is still out as to whether watermelon plays an active role in lowering heart disease risk, Dr. Slavin said. Dr. Slavin, Dr. Ellis and Dr. Dieras all suggested that the amino acid L-citrulline and the micronutrient lycopene \u2014 both abundant in watermelon \u2014 could improve heart health. There\u2019s a rationale for these ideas, Dr. Slavin said. Scientists know that the kidneys convert L-citrulline into nitric oxide, which can relax your artery walls and lower blood pressure. And lycopene, a chemical found in certain plants, can reduce inflammation, which is linked to heart disease. People tend to associate lycopene with tomatoes, but watermelon has more. Still, independently funded human studies directly examining watermelon\u2019s effect on heart health have not shown measurable improvements. \u201cWatermelon is not a magic bullet,\u201d said Dr. Ellis, who led one of the studies. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to displace blood pressure medication or anything like that. But if it\u2019s incorporated into a diet with nutrient-dense foods, it may be a good thing for vascular health.\u201d Watermelon doesn\u2019t lend itself well to canning, drying or freezing, Dr. Slavin said, so it\u2019s harder to enjoy out of season. She thinks this is one reason the fruit is so loved. \u201cWatermelon is summer and happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone cuts open a fresh watermelon and hands you a hunk, that\u2019s when it\u2019s best.\u201d It\u2019s also delicious in a dinner salad, soup or fizzy drink. Here are some recipes from NYT Cooking to get you started. In this satisfying grain bowl, watermelon is paired with farro, cheese, herbs and red onion. You can substitute quicker-cooking rice or quinoa for the farro. Recipe: Farro and Watermelon Salad Keep a pitcher of this chilled soup in the refrigerator for an instant meal on sweltering days. Watermelon tempers the sweetness of overripe summer tomatoes in the blended mix. Recipe: Tomato-Watermelon Gazpacho With Avocado Juicy with chunks of watermelon, tomatoes and cucumber, this ultimate summer salad becomes even more refreshing with a watermelon dressing. Toasted ciabatta and crumbled feta make it filling enough to be a meal. Recipe: Country Panzanella With Watermelon Dressing This savory fruit dish tossed with spicy cumin-citrus dressing could work with any fruit, but is especially good with watermelon. It\u2019s tasty as a stand-alone snack or as a side dish. Recipe: Watermelon Chaat Blitzing watermelon into juice is a brilliant move all summer long.

Some exercisers thrive on the motto of \u201charder, faster, stronger.\u201d Good for them. But that doesn\u2019t work for everybody \u2014 even more so if you are out of practice. For the rest of us, experts suggest a different mantra: easier, slower, stronger. \u201cLess is more when you are trying to start a fitness routine, especially if you dislike exercise,\u201d said Cedric Bryant, the chief executive of the American Council on Exercise in San Diego. The key to long-term health is building a stable fitness habit, not how hard you push. And research suggests that even five to 10 daily minutes of simple activity, like walking or gardening, has health benefits. \u201cPeople have an idea of what exercise looks like, and it\u2019s usually the extreme end of the spectrum,\u201d said Kinsey Cave, a trainer based in Houston with the National Academy of Sports Medicine. \u201cThey have PTSD from high school P.E. class or a militant group exercise class and get totally turned off.\u201d But it\u2019s possible to move the needle on your health without breaking a sweat or even getting off your couch. Low-intensity exercise can be an important way to improve balance, muscle strength and mental health, said Tyler C. Cooper, president of Cooper Aerobics, a health clinic and fitness center in Dallas. For example, a short two-minute stroll up and down the block after dinner helps regulate blood sugar. Even a mellow routine of stretches can be therapeutic if you haven\u2019t been exercising, added Andrew Jagim, director of sports medicine research at the Mayo Clinic Health System in Onalaska, Wis.

Nico Grant reports on Google from San Francisco and Katie Robertson reports on media from New York. When Frank Pine searched Google for a link to a news article two months ago, he encountered paragraphs generated by artificial intelligence about the topic at the top of his results. To see what he wanted, he had to scroll past them. That experience annoyed Mr. Pine, the executive editor of Media News Group and Tribune Publishing, which own 68 daily newspapers across the country. Now, those paragraphs scare him. In May, Google announced that the A.I.-generated summaries, which compile content from news sites and blogs on the topic being searched, would be made available to everyone in the United States. And that change has Mr. Pine and many other publishing executives worried that the paragraphs pose a big danger to their brittle business model, by sharply reducing the amount of traffic to their sites from Google. \u201cIt potentially chokes off the original creators of the content,\u201d Mr. Pine said. The feature, AI Overviews, felt like another step toward generative A.I. replacing \u201cthe publications that they have cannibalized,\u201d he added. Media executives said in interviews that Google had left them in a vexing position. They want their sites listed in Google\u2019s search results, which for some outlets can generate more than half of their traffic. But doing that means Google can use their content in AI Overviews summaries. Publishers could also try to protect their content from Google by forbidding its web crawler from sharing any content snippets from their sites.

Follow our latest updates on the Middle East crisis here. Israel and Hezbollah have fought wars before, most recently in 2006, a monthlong conflict that ended with a United Nations cease-fire resolution calling on both sides to retreat from a 20-mile buffer zone in southern Lebanon along Israel\u2019s northern border. But Hezbollah never withdrew from the region, and Israeli troops crossed into the area late Monday in what the Israeli military called a \u201climited\u201d operation. Here is why Israel said it has sent ground forces into Lebanon: The invasion, which the Israeli military confirmed early Tuesday, is aimed at crippling Hezbollah\u2019s forces and infrastructure in an area of southern Lebanon that the armed group controls, and where it has been known to build underground tunnels leading into Israel. The incursion comes after two weeks of intensive Israeli airstrikes and attacks against the Iranian-backed Lebanese armed group involving exploding pagers and radios. Israeli officials said the assaults were intended in part to eliminate the group\u2019s leadership; an airstrike on Friday killed Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah. But officials had also suggested the attacks could remove the need for a ground invasion. Hezbollah has launched near-daily aerial attacks against Israeli positions since last October. The group says its attacks are in solidarity with Hamas, which attacked Israel on Oct. 7, prompting the Israeli military to go to war in Gaza. It was not immediately clear where the Israeli military was operating in Lebanon, but Israel ordered residents of many southern towns to move north.

Photographs by Sergey Ponomarev Steven Erlanger reported from three refugee camps in the northern West Bank, including Tulkarm and Jenin, where the Israeli military has been conducting regular raids. The alleys are cast in permanent semidarkness, covered by black nylon tarpaulins to hide the Palestinian fighters there from Israeli drones overhead. Green Hamas flags and banners commemorating \u201cmartyrs\u201d hang from the buildings, many badly damaged during Israeli raids and airstrikes to try to tamp down a growing militancy in the territory, fueled by the war in Gaza. This is not Gaza or a traditional Hamas stronghold. It is a refugee camp in Tulkarm, a town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the relatively moderate Palestinian faction of Fatah had long held sway. I recently met a local commander of these young militants, Muhammad Jaber, 25, in one of those dusty, shattered alleyways. One of Israel\u2019s most wanted men, he and other fighters like him say they have switched allegiances from the relatively moderate Fatah faction, which dominates the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to more radical groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Asked what lesson he had taken from the war in Gaza, Mr. Jaber paused for a moment to think. \u201cPatience,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd strength. And courage.\u201d Refugee camps in the northern West Bank, like the one in Tulkarm, have been hotbeds of militancy for years, well before the war in Gaza, as fighters pushed back against ever-increasing Israeli settlement activity and the failure of the peace process to produce a Palestinian state. After Oct. 7, Hamas urged Palestinians to join its uprising against Israel, a call that seems to have been heeded by some in these camps. Militants like Mr. Jaber want to push the Israelis out of the West Bank, which Israel occupied after the 1967 war, and some, like Hamas, want to push the Israelis out of the region entirely.

Today, Dr. Keith cites that event as validation of an idea that has become his life\u2019s work: He believes that by intentionally releasing sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, it would be possible to lower temperatures worldwide, blunting global warming. Such radical interventions are increasingly being taken seriously as the effects of climate change grow more intense. Global temperatures have hit record highs for 13 months in a row, unleashing violent weather, deadly heat waves and raising sea levels. Scientists expect the heat to keep climbing for decades. The main driver of the warming, the burning of fossil fuels, continues more or less unabated. Against this backdrop, there is growing interest in efforts to intentionally alter the Earth\u2019s climate, a field known as geoengineering. Already, major corporations are operating enormous facilities to vacuum up the carbon dioxide that\u2019s heating up the atmosphere and bury it underground. Some scientists are performing experiments designed to brighten clouds, another way to bounce some solar radiation back to space. Others are working on efforts to make oceans and plants absorb more carbon dioxide. But of all these ideas, it is stratospheric solar geoengineering that elicits the greatest hope and the greatest fear. Proponents see it as a relatively cheap and fast way to reduce temperatures well before the world has stopped burning fossil fuels. Harvard University has a solar geoengineering program that has received grants from the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. It\u2019s being studied by the Environmental Defense Fund along with the World Climate Research Program, an international scientific effort. The European Union last year called for a thorough analysis of the risks of geoengineering and said countries should discuss how to regulate an eventual deployment of the technology. But many scientists and environmentalists fear that it could result in unpredictable calamities. Because it would be used in the stratosphere and not limited to a particular area, solar geoengineering could affect the whole world, possibly scrambling natural systems, like creating rain in one arid region while drying out the monsoon season elsewhere. Opponents worry it would distract from the urgent work of transitioning away from fossil fuels. They object to intentionally releasing sulfur dioxide, a pollutant that would eventually move from the stratosphere to ground level, where it can irritate the skin, eyes, nose and throat and can cause respiratory problems. And they fear that once begun, a solar geoengineering program would be difficult to stop. \u201cThe whole notion of spraying sulfur compounds to reflect sunlight is arrogant and simplistic,\u201d the Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki said. \u201cThere are unintended consequences of powerful technologies like these, and we have no idea what they will be.\u201d Raymond Pierrehumbert, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Oxford, said he considered solar geoengineering a grave threat to human civilization. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a bad idea in terms of something that would never be safe to deploy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even doing research on it is not just a waste of money, but actively dangerous.\u201d Shuchi Talati, the founder of a nonprofit organization called the Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, called the technology \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d \u201cIt could be a way to limit human suffering,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, I think it can also exacerbate suffering if used in a bad way.\u201d In a series of interviews, Dr. Keith, a professor in the University of Chicago\u2019s department of geophysical sciences, countered that the risks posed by solar geoengineering are well understood, not as severe as portrayed by critics and dwarfed by the potential benefits. If the technique slowed the warming of the planet by even just one degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, over the next century, Dr. Keith said, it could help prevent millions of heat-related deaths each decade. A planet transformed by solar geoengineering would not be noticeably dimmer during the daytime, according to his calculations. But it could produce a different kind of twilight, one with an orange hue. He agrees that nations should stop burning coal, oil and gas, period. But Dr. Keith believes in going further. Lean and athletic at 60, with glacier-blue eyes, Dr. Keith has spent his life outside the lab rock climbing, sea kayaking and skiing in the Arctic. He is deeply troubled by the myriad ways climate change is disrupting the natural world. If there were a global referendum tomorrow on whether to begin solar geoengineering, he said he would vote in favor. \u201cThere certainly are risks, and there certainly are uncertainties,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s really a lot of evidence that the risks are quantitatively small compared to the benefits, and the uncertainties just aren\u2019t that big.\u201d The only thing more dangerous than his solution, he suggested, may be not using it at all. To understand just how contentious Dr. Keith\u2019s work can be, consider what happened when he tried to perform an initial test in preparation for a solar geoengineering experiment known as Scopex. Then a professor at Harvard, Dr. Keith wanted to release a few pounds of mineral dust at an altitude of roughly 20 kilometers and track how the dust behaved as it floated across the sky. A test was planned in 2018, possibly over Arizona, but Dr. Keith couldn\u2019t find a partner to launch a high-altitude balloon. When details of that plan became public, a group of Indigenous people objected and issued a manifesto against geoengineering. Three years later, Harvard hired the Swedish space corporation to launch a balloon that would carry the equipment for the test. But before it took place, local groups once again rose up in protest. The Saami Council, an organization representing Indigenous peoples, said it viewed solar geoengineering \u201cto be the direct opposite of the respect we as Indigenous Peoples are taught to treat nature with.\u201d Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, joined the chorus. \u201cNature is doing everything it can,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s screaming at us to back off, to stop \u2014 and we are doing the exact opposite.\u201d Within months, the experiment was called off. \u201cA lesson I\u2019ve learned from this is that if we do this again, we won\u2019t be open in the same way,\u201d Dr. Keith said. Behind the scenes, the Harvard team and its advisory committee became mired in finger pointing over who was to blame for the collapse of the project. Dr. Talati, a member of the Scopex advisory board, said it was \u201cthe moment of peak chaos.\u201d It didn\u2019t help that there were personality conflicts. Several committee members said Dr. Keith could be ornery and headstrong, correcting colleagues in casual conversation and belittling those with whom he disagreed. \u201cI can be abrasive and difficult,\u201d Dr. Keith acknowledged. \u201cI am sometimes inappropriately forceful in making my point. I\u2019m intense.\u201d Opponents of solar geoengineering cite several main risks. They say it could create a \u201cmoral hazard,\u201d mistakenly giving people the impression that it is not necessary to rapidly reduce fossil fuel emissions. \u201cThe fundamental problem is that we think we\u2019re so smart that we don\u2019t have to pay attention to nature\u2019s boundaries,\u201d Dr. Suzuki said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t dealt with the root cause of the problem, which is us.\u201d The second main concern has to do with unintended consequences. \u201cThis is a really dangerous path to go down,\u201d said Beatrice Rindevall, the chairwoman of the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, which opposed the experiment. \u201cIt could shock the climate system, could alter hydrological cycles and could exacerbate extreme weather and climate instability.\u201d And once solar geoengineering began to cool the planet, stopping the effort abruptly could result in a sudden rise in temperatures, a phenomenon known as \u201ctermination shock.\u201d The planet could experience \u201cpotentially massive temperature rise in an unprepared world over a matter of five to 10 years, hitting the Earth\u2019s climate with something that it probably hasn\u2019t seen since the dinosaur-killing impactor,\u201d Dr. Pierrehumbert said. On top of all this, there are fears about rogue actors using solar geoengineering and concerns that the technology could be weaponized. Not to mention the fact that sulfur dioxide can harm human health. Dr. Keith is adamant that those fears are overblown. And while there would be some additional air pollution, he claims the risk is negligible compared to the benefits. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of uncertainty about climate responses,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s pretty hard to imagine if you do a limited amount of hemispherically balanced solar geo that you don\u2019t reduce temperatures everywhere.\u201d Last year, after the failure to launch the Scopex experiment in Sweden, Dr. Keith made a move that stunned his colleagues. He announced he was closing the door on 13 years at Harvard and taking his ambitions to the University of Chicago, where he would build a new program around climate interventions, including solar geoengineering. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that stuff will ever get used,\u201d said Mr. Gates, a major investor in climate technology. \u201cI do believe that doing the research and understanding it makes sense.\u201d Dr. Keith\u2019s career can be traced to his father, Tony Keith, a wildlife biologist who attended the first global gathering to address threats to nature, the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm.  Dyslexia prevented him from learning to read until late in 4th grade, but when he was finally able to make sense of written words, he became a voracious reader. He also loved camping and, at 17, hiked a stretch of the Appalachian Trail solo. After graduating from the University of Toronto, he spent months rock climbing. Looking for a way to get paid to live in the wilderness, he got a job studying walruses in the Canadian Arctic. Dr. Keith eventually enrolled in a doctoral program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study experimental physics. In 1992, he published an academic paper, \u201cA Serious Look at Geoengineering,\u201d that raised the questions that would shape his career: Who should authorize the use of these technologies? Who is liable if something goes wrong? His academic career took him from Carnegie Mellon University to the University of Calgary, where he began investigating ways to capture and store carbon dioxide. The next stop was Harvard, where he got serious about solar geoengineering. In 2006, a mutual acquaintance introduced him to Mr. Gates, who wanted to learn more about technologies that might help fight global warming. The two men discussed climate and technology in a series of meetings over the next 10 years. Then in 2009, Dr. Keith founded Carbon Engineering, a company that developed a process for pulling carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Investors included Mr. Gates, Chevron and N. Murray Edwards, who made billions pumping oil from the Canadian oil sands. Last year Carbon Engineering was acquired by Occidental Petroleum, a major oil and gas producer based in Texas, for $1.1 billion. Dr. Keith owned about 4 percent of the company at the time of the sale, delivering him a personal windfall of about $72 million. Occidental is now building a series of enormous carbon capture plants. It plans to sell carbon credits to big companies like Amazon and AT&T that want to offset their emissions. Critics say that will only delay the phaseout of fossil fuels while allowing an oil company to profit. \u201cOf course I\u2019m uncomfortable about it being sold to an oil company, no question,\u201d Dr. Keith said, adding that he plans to give away most of his profits from the sale of Carbon Engineering, perhaps to a conservation group. On a summer Monday in Cambridge, Mass., the Harvard campus was mostly quiet. But inside one classroom, a standing-room-only crowd listened as experts discussed the merits and risks of solar geoengineering. Among those featured was Frank Keutsch, Dr. Keith\u2019s former collaborator on the Scopex experiment. Dr. Keutsch is less sanguine than Dr. Keith when considering its potential risks. \u201cI compare stratospheric solar geoengineering with opiates,\u201d he said on the panel. \u201cThey only treat the symptom and not the actual cause. You can get addicted to it if you don\u2019t actually address the cause. In addition, like any painkiller, you\u2019re going to have side effects. And then there are withdrawal symptoms, and that\u2019s termination shock.\u201d Dr. Keutsch is now investigating whether calcium carbonate or diamond dust might be a better material than sulfur, and pondering issues around how a deployment might one day be governed. There are no current plans for a field experiment. Academic energy in the field has followed Dr. Keith to the University of Chicago, which is allowing him to hire 10 full-time faculty members and build a new program focused on various types of geoengineering. The total cost could reach as much as $100 million. The move has puzzled some. Dr. Pierrehumbert, who recently departed the University of Chicago for Oxford, said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d and contended that those research dollars could be better spent investigating ways to reduce the use of fossil fuels. To celebrate his 60th birthday in October, Dr. Keith went hiking in the Canadian Rockies and came across a glacier that had shrunk dramatically in recent years. It was a visual reminder that global warming is upending the natural world, and it confirmed his central, controversial belief: Humans have already altered the planet, heating the climate with greenhouse gases. To repair the climate and return it to a more pristine state, we may need to take even more drastic action and engineer the stratosphere. \u201cI\u2019m more motivated even now to push on solar geo because the rationalist case for it is looking stronger,\u201d Dr. Keith said. \u201cWhile there are still lots of strong individual voices of opposition, there are a lot of people in serious policy positions that are taking it seriously, and that\u2019s really exciting.\u201d Read by David Gelles Audio produced by Sarah Diamond.

Russia on Sunday bombarded residential areas of Ukraine\u2019s second largest city, Kharkiv, with ballistic missiles and powerful guided bombs, wounding more than 40 civilians, Ukrainian officials said. The attack came hours after what Russian authorities said was a wave of drone attacks against energy facilities across Russia, including an oil refinery in Moscow. At least 10 explosions rocked Kharkiv, a city of 1.3 million situated less than 25 miles from the Russian border, local officials said, warning that they expected the number of casualties to rise as emergency crews raced across the city to various blast sites. The attack on Kharkiv came less than 48 hours after powerful Russian guided bombs hit the city on Friday, striking a 12-story residential building and devastating a children\u2019s park. At least six people were killed in those strikes, including a 14-year-old girl. Another 59 people were reported injured, with 20 in serious condition and some requiring amputations, Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv military administration, said in a statement. In the attack on Sunday, Mr. Syniehubov said that a post office, a sports complex, a shopping center, stores and cars were damaged. \u201cThe enemy targeted only civilian infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Syniehubov said. In a later statement, he said that at least 41 people were wounded. The Russian Ministry of Defense did not offer any immediate comment on the strikes in Kharkiv. The city\u2019s Palace of Sports, which features a 4,000-seat arena, was targeted by four strikes, Ukraine\u2019s National Olympic Committee said in a statement. \u201cThe sports complex was destroyed,\u201d the committee said.

  "2025-04-27_98178_1": "Trump Administration Supported by The longest-lived president also wrote more best-selling books than any modern president \u2014 and had the fewest written about him. Ian Prasad Philbrick combed through a list of more than 6,500 best-selling books to report this story. An earlier version of this article was published on Oct. 1. Jimmy Carter, the longest-lived U.S. president in history, holds another, less noticed distinction: He\u2019s the most prolific author of any president in a century. Mr. Carter wrote or co-wrote 32 books in his lifetime, 20 of which became New York Times best sellers. But that expansive literary legacy has a flip side. Just 16 books written by others that prominently deal with Mr. Carter or his administration have made the best-seller list, a stark contrast to the dozens of volumes lavished on every other modern president. The result is a striking fact: Mr. Carter, who died at 100 on Sunday, was in many ways a president who had a lot more to say than has been said about him. That ratio \u2014 best sellers written by a president before, during and after his presidency versus best sellers written about him \u2014 can be calculated for commanders in chief going back to 1931, when The Times first began tracking hardcover nonfiction book sales. Doing so reveals a few patterns. President Carter has written 20 best-selling books during his lifetime, more than the number of best-selling books that have been written about him. Source: New York Times best-sellers lists, 1931-October 2024 The clearest lesson is that while Americans like to read and write about their presidents, they don\u2019t read or write about all of them equally.

Dear Members of the Harvard Community, It is with a heavy heart but a deep love for Harvard that I write to share that I will be stepping down as president. This is not a decision I came to easily. Indeed, it has been difficult beyond words because I have looked forward to working with so many of you to advance the commitment to academic excellence that has propelled this great university across centuries. But, after consultation with members of the Corporation, it has become clear that it is in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge with a focus on the institution rather than any individual. It is a singular honor to be a member of this university, which has been my home and my inspiration for most of my professional career. My deep sense of connection to Harvard and its people has made it all the more painful to witness the tensions and divisions that have riven our community in recent months, weakening the bonds of trust and reciprocity that should be our sources of strength and support in times of crisis. Amidst all of this, it has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor \u2014 two bedrock values that are fundamental to who I am \u2014 and frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus. I believe in the people of Harvard because I see in you the possibility and the promise of a better future. These last weeks have helped make clear the work we need to do to build that future \u2014 to combat bias and hate in all its forms, to create a learning environment in which we respect each other\u2019s dignity and treat one another with compassion, and to affirm our enduring commitment to open inquiry and free expression in the pursuit of truth. I believe we have within us all that we need to heal from this period of tension and division and to emerge stronger. I had hoped with all my heart to lead us on that journey, in partnership with all of you. As I now return to the faculty, and to the scholarship and teaching that are the lifeblood of what we do, I pledge to continue working alongside you to build the community we all deserve. When I became president, I considered myself particularly blessed by the opportunity to serve people from around the world who saw in my presidency a vision of Harvard that affirmed their sense of belonging \u2014 their sense that Harvard welcomes people of talent and promise, from every background imaginable, to learn from and grow with one another. To all of you, please know that those doors remain open, and Harvard will be stronger and better because they do. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

Publicly suggest the return of Alsace to Germany as evidence that you, too, believe that territorial sovereignty should be negotiable. To Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, another suggestion: If you\u2019re going to dangle the prospect of closer ties between Ukraine and NATO (but not full membership) as a way of pushing Kyiv into a diplomatic settlement with Moscow, why not invite several battalions of Russian armor to the vicinity of Berlin? That would demonstrate that you, too, are willing to adjust the verdict of 1991 to mollify the Kremlin\u2019s resentment, greed and paranoia. These are preposterous suggestions.

Those who now argue that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine needs to be \u201crealistic\u201d or \u201cpragmatic\u201d \u2014 that is, that he should stop short of pursuing a complete Russian withdrawal from all occupied Ukrainian territories \u2014 are proposing a solution they would never countenance for their own countries under ordinary circumstances, let alone during a struggle for national survival.

What will matter in 2073 is whether he reversed the global tide of democratic retreat that began long before his presidency but reached new lows with the Taliban\u2019s victory in Afghanistan and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. If Biden can turn it, it will be a historic achievement. If not, much darker days will lie ahead. He has a real chance. On the positive side, there is last week\u2019s announcement of 31 M-1 Abrams tanks for Ukraine, unlocking German Leopard 2 tanks to be sent as well. The decision brings Ukraine a significant step closer to eventual NATO membership, to which it has more than earned the right. Then there\u2019s the apparent end of attempts to revive the Iran nuclear deal and a visibly tougher posture by the administration toward Tehran\u2019s misogynistic tyrants, including, last week, the largest-ever joint military exercise with Israel. And there is the president\u2019s repeated public statements that the U.S. will defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.

And that is really the crux of this debate we are having,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not black and white.\u201d\n \n\tAmerica\u2019s fight over abortion has long circled a question, one that is broad and without consensus:\n \n\tWhen does life begin?\n \n\tIn the months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, it has become unavoidable, as activists and politicians try to squeeze concrete answers from an eternal question of human existence.\n \n\tLawmakers and judges from Arizona to South Carolina have been reviewing exactly which week of development during pregnancy the procedure should be allowed. Some states draw the line at conception, or six weeks or 15 or around 40. Many others point to viability, the time when a fetus can survive outside the uterus. The implication is that after the determined time, the developing embryo or fetus is a human being with rights worth protecting.\n \n\tOver the summer, when lawmakers in Indiana fought over passing a law banning most all abortions from conception, Republicans argued at length that a fertilized egg was a human life, at times citing their Christian principles \u2014 that \u201chuman life begins at conception\u201d and \u201cGod our creator says you shall not murder.\u201d A Democrat pointed to another answer found in Title 35-31.5-2-160 of the Indiana code: \u201c\u2018Human being\u2019 means an individual who has been born and is alive.\u201d A disagreement over abortion policy became a fight over what it means to be human, the tension between conception and birth, church and state.\n \n\tYet the question goes far beyond politics, law and science into the heart of human experience. The creation of children, the essence of the human person and the survival of the species can pull at the most sacred parts of our lives, wrapping together love and death, hope and grief. Amid the societal upheaval, women continue to become pregnant, have miscarriages and give birth. They feel first kicks and see detailed sonograms. A pregnant woman uses her own nutrients and blood to grow offspring, breathing for it until birth. The growing fetus transforms the woman\u2019s body, and can even threaten her life.\n \n\tPublic opinion reflects the range and complexity of belief. Most Americans support the right to an abortion, but within limits, and they disagree on what exactly those limits should be. But almost uniformly across gender, politics and religion, they believe that how long a woman has been pregnant should matter in determining whether the procedure is legal. More than half of American adults say the statement \u201chuman life begins at conception, so a fetus is a person with rights\u201d describes their views at least somewhat well, according to the Pew Research Center.\n \n            This question goes far beyond politics, law and science into the heart of human experience. Every culture and time have determined their own answers, and now we want to hear from you.\n         \n\tThe question of when life begins has been so politicized it can be hard to thoughtfully engage. Even the question can be confusingly broad in what it is asking. In biological terms, when is an organism an organism? Or philosophically, what makes a human a person? And spiritually, what is the relationship between the body and the soul?\n \n\tAmander Clark, president-elect of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, has examined the question for years as a stem cell biologist. Recently she asked her 5-year-old when life begins, and smiled at his reply: \u201cThat\u2019s a chicken and egg question, Mom!\u201d\n \n\tThe question is a very complicated one, she said.\n \n\t\u201cFrom the biologist point of view, I\u2019d need to say life of a mammalian organism begins at fertilization,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if the question is, when is a human a human being, to me that is very different.\u201d\n \n\tEven Pope Francis, leader of one of the most prominent forces opposing abortion, acknowledges the complexity.\n \n\t\u201cIn any book of embryology, it is said that shortly before one month after conception the organs and the DNA are already delineated in the tiny fetus, before the mother even becomes aware,\u201d he said in a recent interview with the magazine America. \u201cTherefore, there is a living human being. I do not say a person, because this is debated, but a living human being.\u201d\n \n\tFor generations, the mystery of human life has been wrestled by philosophers and scientists, felt by mothers and midwives. Every culture and time has determined its own answers.\n \n\tAncient Chinese medicine spoke of two essences joining together, of mother and father, blood and semen, to generate a child who is intertwined with the mother until birth. Ancient Egypt gave the power to create new human life almost entirely to men. Jewish communities have long pointed to life beginning with a baby\u2019s first breath, recalling the Genesis story of God breathing the breath of life, or the soul, into the first man.\n \n\tThe Western perspective has been largely shaped by Christianity, a religion that was quite literally born from a pregnant woman who, as the biblical story goes, carried a divine child when an angel told her that was God\u2019s plan. From the faith\u2019s earliest days, many theologians have seen the soul as something God creates and puts into a body in utero, though they have differed on when, exactly, this \u201censoulment\u201d occurs.\n \n\tIn the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas, following the philosophers Augustine and Aristotle, posed that the \u201crational soul\u201d came into being not immediately but at around 40 days for a male and about twice that for a female, the time he thought \u201cquickening\u201d happened. Quickening, the stage in pregnancy in which a woman starts to feel movement in her uterus, actually happens around four or five months, regardless of sex. In medieval Christian Europe, an ensoulment that was not immediate helped to address anxiety around pregnancy loss, given the prevalence of miscarriages and stillbirths, and Catholic teaching that only baptized souls could be saved. The Catholic Church generally held this view of a later fetal ensoulment for the next 600 years.\n \n\tThe scientific revolution, from Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution to reproductive science, disrupted centuries of thought on human life.\n \n\tNick Hopwood, a professor at the University of Cambridge, has spent years researching the history of reproduction. The question of when life begins may be inherited from the idea of ensoulment, and the idea that you can pinpoint a specific moment when that happens, but by the 20th century many biologists rejected the question as \u201cnot a good question,\u201d he said.\n \n\t\u201cThe egg is alive, the sperm is alive, the cells from which they develop are alive, it is a continuum,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be slightly more acceptance of the question, \u2018When does a life begin?\u2019 And then different biologists might point to different stages.\u201d\n \n\tScientific consensus around conception emerged in the 1870s, when a German scientist watched through a microscope as the nuclei of sea urchin sperm and egg fused. It was during this period of scientific advancement and social conflict that Pope Pius IX shifted ensoulment to conception.\n \n\tPopular discourse today often references \u201cthe moment\u201d of conception, but fertilization is a complex biological process that can occur about two weeks after a woman has a period, if female and male sex cells meet. A woman\u2019s ovary releases an egg, which moves down the fallopian tube, a duct whose cells interact with incoming male sperm cells and change a sperm cell\u2019s composition so it can fuse with the egg.\n \n\tThe cell begins to divide, and after several days it has become a ball of about 100 cells, of which only a small fraction give rise to the human embryo. The rest will create things like the placenta, a new organ that a woman\u2019s body makes with an umbilical cord to share her nutrients and oxygen with the embryo.\n \n\tFor about 14 days after conception, this small but growing group of cells can potentially divide into separate entities, leading to twins or triplets. That possibility largely ends at implantation, when biochemical interactions allow the cells to attach to the wall of the uterus. Then, a specialized process called gastrulation begins, when the embryo cells begin to differentiate into systems to organize the body.\n \n\tThe discovery of DNA reshaped ideas about what made a person an individual. Fertilization, when a human gets its genome, has become a modern kind of ensoulment, said Scott Gilbert, professor emeritus of biology at Swarthmore College, a co-author of a prominent textbook on developmental biology.\n \n\t\u201cIt is a creation story myth, it is an origin story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe female myth, the myth of birth, is replaced by the male myth of fertilization.\u201d\n \n\tThe biological story of fertilization has too often been simplified, inaccurately, into a hero tale of a strong sperm swimming to penetrate an egg, he said. There is no violent penetration, but rather the two cells\u2019 membranes dissolve \u2014 they sort of spoon, he said \u2014 to share genetic material to create a one-cell entity called a zygote. In the process of natural development, scientists estimate that up to or around two-thirds of zygotes do not result in a live birth, though the number is difficult to determine. Many fertilized eggs do not implant, and even after that some pregnancies naturally fail.\n \n\tDevelopment is a progressive continuum as cells realize unique purposes, systems interact and body parts grow. Different scientific fields focus on different stages to evaluate pivotal moments, whether that is fertilization, embryonic cell differentiation, or cardiac or brain activity. The entire process takes about 40 weeks, until the next major developmental moment: birth. Key phases for heart development occur in the first few weeks, along the way and at the end. At birth, the baby\u2019s first breath changes its cardiac anatomy.\n \n\tFor years in the United States, a focal point has been 23 or 24 weeks of development, called viability, when the fetus may be able to survive outside the uterus. Around the time of the Roe decision in the 1970s, available technology meant that viability was around 28 weeks.\n \n\tAdvances over the past half-century have offered far more understanding of fetal development than humans have ever had. Babies can now be born through assisted reproductive technologies. 4D ultrasounds show lifelike images inside the uterus. Fetal surgeons can treat spina bifida at 24 weeks after conception. In 2020, a baby boy was born in Alabama at 21 weeks and one day and lived, setting a Guinness world record.\n \n\tDr. Brendan B. Mitchell is an obstetrician-gynecologist and the longtime medical director for Advice and Aid Pregnancy Centers in Overland Park, Kan., which opposes abortion and provides some support for pregnant women.\n \n\tHe struggles with what he feels is inconsistency in how society values premature babies versus developing fetuses. Doctors work hard to save babies born at 23 or 24 weeks, and people spend millions of dollars to help patients born prematurely, he said, but in some places it is legal to terminate a pregnancy at that time.\n \n\t\u201cThat point of viability is getting constantly pushed back,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat defines that person as a person or a life \u2014 is it what their parents think?\u201d\n \n\tWhile American society has worked over decades to come to a consensus on when death occurs, there has not been similar cultural agreement on when life begins, he said.\n \n\tIn biology, scientists research how humans develop not as persons, but into independent organisms. There is less attention to what else is happening during that same 40-week period: the state of pregnancy.\n \n\tPregnancy is a woman \u201cmaking a new organism with her body,\u201d said Elselijn Kingma, a professor at the King\u2019s College London who specializes in pregnancy through both science and philosophy.\n \n\tIt is a unique state where one organism grows, as part of itself, a fetus which will eventually detach and become its own, independent organism, she said. It is a state \u201cwhere the other person can only exist by grace of the constant provision and nourishment of another,\u201d she said.\n \n\tIt does not follow that a fetus is not an organism before birth \u2014 sometimes organisms can be part of other organisms \u2014 or that a pregnant human should be allowed to treat the fetus as any other body part, Dr. Kingma said. Body parts are not all the same: Hair is different from kidneys, and cutting hair is different from cutting kidneys, she said, and \u201cobviously the fetus is quite an unusual body part.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cThat is just not a relationship we really have space for, like our law and our morality, they all assume that we have separate bodies,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the really tricky question: What does morality demand? And then, what can the law enforce, and what can society demand, in that unique state of intertwinement?\u201d\n \n\tThe question of when human life begins is a difficult one, but Dr. Kingma believes society should turn its attention to what she feels is the larger, even harder question: \u201cWhat kind of entitlement on the body of another does a human have?\u201d\n \n\tThe search for answers pushes past science. It is tied to a society\u2019s values, a person\u2019s sense of self and a cultural understanding of what it means to be human. Spiritual thinkers and philosophers, who have long explored these realms, say it requires social choice, and an interrogation of our ethics.\n \n\tIn the United States, there has long been a unique focus on the individual, and individual freedoms, often instead of the community or ecosystem. For the question of a new human life, that has led to an either/or priority on the pregnant woman or the developing baby.\n \n\t\u201cWe think we are having a debate in the United States about when life begins, but we are not,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Fuentes, an anthropologist at Princeton University. \u201cWe are having a debate about when society is going to decide that the person counts. And not only when the person counts, but which person counts more.\u201d\n \n\tAs someone who studies biological societies and human evolution, he grows frustrated at the individual focus, which he sees as atypical for the human species.\n \n\t\u201cWe should be asking questions about our community. What is best not for an individual but for a society, for mothers, for families, for communities,\u201d he said.\n \n\tIf everyone agrees the ultimate goal is to maximize health, a different set of questions arises, he said.\n \n\t\u201cHow do we create and foster the healthiest possible outcomes for individuals and for communities, it can\u2019t just be either/or,\u201d he said.\n \n\tMany Indigenous communities consider the idea of \u201cperson\u201d as what it means to be born a member of a people, said Andrea Sullivan-Clarke, a philosophy professor and member of the Wind Clan of the Muscogee Nation of Oklahoma.\n \n\tWith relationship at the center, the focus becomes community, and shifts to how to contribute to the people and treat children and women, she said.\n \n\tEven the act of considering future generations means that in some way, they already exist, she said.\n \n\t\u201cWe need to look at the obligations that we have to others, and to nature,\u201d she said. \u201cI have obligations to the mountains and the trees and the rivers and ancestors and future generations. That is going to inform how I view the world and what I need to do in order to live in it in the right way.\u201d\n \n\tMaking decisions about how to live, and live together as a society, can be extraordinarily difficult.\n \n\tBut hardship is something to prepare for, not run away from, said the Rev. Cristina Moon, a priest at a Rinzai Zen temple in Honolulu.\n \n\tShe teaches meditation followed by martial arts, as a way to train for life\u2019s adversities. Families and parents face myriad complex circumstances that don\u2019t fit neatly into dualistic ethical frameworks, well beyond abortion, she said. What matters is developing courage and spiritual strength, she said \u2014 and compassion.\n \n\t\u201cWe can\u2019t know all of the things that somebody is having to take into account to make a really hard decision,\u201d she said.\n \n\t\u201cWhen does the responsibility for a life begin and end?\u201d\n Explore more of life\u2019s big questions Dec. 31, 2021 Apr. 5, 2021 May 31, 2022 December 20, 2020 Produced by Heather Casey, Leo Dominguez, Rebecca Lieberman and Meghan Louttit.

Jack Nicas and Laurence Blair traveled across Paraguay \u2014 from the capital, Asunci\u00f3n, to its remote north, the Chaco \u2014 to interview candidates and voters in Sunday\u2019s election. POZO COLORADO, Paraguay \u2014 Paraguayans elected Santiago Pe\u00f1a, a 44-year-old conservative economist, as their new president on Sunday, keeping the South American nation in the control of the right-wing Colorado Party that has run the country for all but five of the past 76 years. The result means that Paraguay, a landlocked nation of seven million people, has resisted the leftward shift across Latin America in recent years. Instead, Paraguayans delivered victory to a right-wing candidate who made vague promises to add jobs, lower energy prices and clear drug addicts from the street. Mr. Pe\u00f1a had 43 percent of the vote with 99 percent of the ballots counted, defeating two challengers who split the opposition vote. His election could complicate Paraguay\u2019s relationship with the United States, a close ally. Mr. Pe\u00f1a is a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of a former Paraguayan president, Horacio Cartes, who is one of its richest men and the president of the Colorado Party. In January, the American Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Mr. Cartes over accusations that he had doled out millions of dollars in bribes to pave his way to power and that he had built ties to the Islamist militant group Hezbollah. In his victory speech Sunday night, Mr. Pe\u00f1a stood next to Mr. Cartes, hugged him and thanked him first. \u201cYour contribution, president, can only be paid with the currency of respect, of appreciation and approval,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cThank you for this Colorado victory.\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a\u2019s victory shows that his party has retained a firm grip on Paraguayan society decades after the fall of the dictatorship of Gen.

The \u201cSuccession\u201d world tour stops in Los Angeles this week, where the Waystar power-players are gathering at their Hollywood studio for Investor Day. The plan is to show off a line of state-of-the-art retirement communities called \u201cLiving+,\u201d which Logan signed off on before he died. But secretly, Kendall and Roman are hoping their pitch will bump the stock price up so high before the GoJo acquisition that Lukas Matsson backs out of the deal. Less secretly, the brothers plus Shiv are on a mission to impress the grown-ups watching them, in what amounts to their public debut as the stewards of Logan\u2019s legacy \u2014 which they each, in their own inadequate way, try to uphold. Let\u2019s start with Shiv, and her ongoing covert communication with Matsson. Last week I speculated that the two of them may have them had conversations in Norway we were not privy to, about his negotiations with the Roy boys. This latest episode begins with a rejection of that theory, as Shiv and Matsson meet on her private jet and he surprises her with his description of how the meeting on the mountaintop went. Throughout the day she keeps him posted on how things are going with Living+ \u2014 a Waystar initiative he plans to kill as soon as he takes over. Matsson\u2019s words are still ringing in Shiv\u2019s ears when she reaches Los Angeles and hears her brothers tell the Waystar executives that Matsson melted down at that last meeting \u2014 and that maybe they should think twice about recommending a deal to the board with \u201ca person of this character.\u201d Shiv knows they are lying to tank the deal, and that they are cutting her out of their play. Roman, genuinely sorry after she calls them out, asks her, \u201cCan we do the huggy thing?\u201d But she does not seem to be in a forgiving mood. As for Roman, he is struggling with the interpersonal part of being in charge. Because he has favors to bestow and firing power, he thinks everyone he deals with at Waystar should just take his money and do as he asks. But at a meeting with a studio executive, he first suffers through her offer of condolences \u2014 \u201cRefused!\u201d he jokes \u2014 and then groans when she complains about ATN\u2019s far-right lean. Roman\u2019s initial response is to troll, by making a snide comment about the \u201cincredibly evolved, ruthlessly segregated\u201d community of Los Angeles. Then he decides it would be easier just to terminate her. When Gerri finds out what Roman did, she tries to play the mentor again, warning that he is \u201ca weak monarch in a dangerous interregnum\u201d and noting, \u201cYou cannot win against the money.\u201d He snaps back, saying she is being disrespectful and adding, \u201cI need you to believe that I am as good as my dad.\u201d She replies, \u201cSay it or believe it?\u201d So he fires her too.

WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans in Congress sharply questioned senior Pentagon officials on Tuesday about the tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid the United States has sent to Ukraine, casting fresh doubt on whether they would embrace future spending as Democrats pleaded for a cleareyed assessment of how much more money would be needed. The exchanges at two House committee hearings, coming just days after the anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, highlighted how concerns about the high cost of sending weapons to Kyiv have intensified on Capitol Hill. The growing doubts have threatened what has been a strong bipartisan consensus in favor of the aid, and could make it more difficult for the Biden administration to win congressional approval of funds to replenish its military assistance accounts. The funding inflection point could come as soon as this summer, months earlier than previously expected. The hearings also illustrated how members of both parties, despite expressing confidence that a majority in Congress remains committed to supporting Ukraine, are concerned that a determined minority \u2014 including right-wing Republicans who eschew U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts and liberal antiwar Democrats \u2014 may weaken that resolve if the war continues to drag on. \u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about accountability,\u201d Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, who has supported Ukraine funding ventures in the past, said during a House Armed Services Committee hearing. \u201cPlease, let\u2019s get this publicized so the American people can trust what the expenditures are.\u201d Tensions were on display Tuesday as Representative Andrew Clyde, a Georgia Republican and an outspoken critic of funding for Ukraine, quizzed a top Defense Department official about allegations of lost and diverted weapons, whistle-blowers and fraud. \u201cAccountability of the weapons shipped in is absolutely paramount, especially the most sensitive weapons, to ensure they are being used for their intended purposes and not diverted for nefarious purposes,\u201d Mr. Clyde told Robert P.

The circumstances of the killing were disputed and risked raising tensions during Ramadan. JERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli police shot dead an Arab man early Saturday in disputed circumstances in front of an entrance to the most prominent holy site in Jerusalem, in an episode that risked escalating tensions in the city at an already volatile time. A police spokeswoman said that officers had stopped the man for questioning because he was inside the Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to both Jews and Muslims, after it had formally closed. Seconds later, the spokeswoman said, the man seized and fired a police officer\u2019s gun, leading them to kill him in self-defense. The police described the man as a terrorist. In a conflicting account, the Palestinian news media reported that he had been killed during a scuffle after intervening to prevent the assault of an Arab woman. Neither version could be immediately corroborated. The police spokeswoman said that no woman had been present, and that it was not possible to provide video evidence, because there was no nearby surveillance camera and the officers did not have time to switch on their body cameras before the scuffle began.

  "2025-04-27_675047_1": "Supported by The decision to charge the men, considered to be ringleaders in the assassination plot, in the United States is an indication of the chronic dysfunction of the Haitian justice system. WASHINGTON \u2014 Three Haitian Americans and a Colombian national have been charged in the United States with involvement in the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse of Haiti, the Justice Department said on Tuesday. The announcement of the charges from the federal government \u2014 more than 18 months after the murder of Mr. Mo\u00efse \u2014 outlined a sprawling conspiracy to murder the Haitian leader and seize power, supported by an unnamed former Haitian Supreme Court judge, Colombian mercenaries and an illegal arms shipment from the United States. The decision to charge the four men, who are considered to be some of the ringleaders in the assassination plot, in the United States is an indication of the chronic dysfunction of the Haitian justice system. Government institutions have disintegrated after Mr. Mo\u00efse\u2019s assassination, and conditions in the country have worsened in recent months. Three of the four men were charged with conspiracy in the murder of Mr. Mo\u00efse: James Solages and Joseph Vincent, who are dual Haitian American citizens, and Germ\u00e1n Alejandro Rivera Garc\u00eda, a Colombian accused of leading a group of mercenaries operating in Haiti. Dr. Christian Emmanuel Sanon, another dual Haitian American citizen, was charged with counts related to smuggling. Three other men had already been charged in the United States in connection with the assassination plot. Whether other powerful business and political figures in Haiti \u2014 including some senior officials in the current government \u2014 conspired in the plot remains a central question in the case.

  "2025-04-27_413458_1": "Russia-Ukraine War Supported by Hours before Russian troops began withdrawing from the suburban town, a Russian soldier left a trail of blood and devastated lives in a last paroxysm of violence. BUCHA, Ukraine \u2014 On one of the last nights of the Russian occupation of Bucha, a lone Russian soldier, drunk or high, went out looking for wine. He forced a 75-year-old resident at gunpoint along the street and made him bang on the doors of private homes. What unfolded thereafter was a night of horror for two families that stands as a coda to a month of senseless killings by Russian troops in Bucha, a suburb of Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv. The Russian soldier left a trail of blood and devastated lives in a last paroxysm of violence only hours before Russian troops began withdrawing. His own unit fetched him in the morning, disposed of the bodies, and within hours, it was gone. Nine months after those events, the dead have mostly been recovered and laid to rest, and people have picked up their lives and returned to work. But the grief of family members remains raw, and the pain inflicted on this small section of one neighborhood by this Russian soldier and his comrades still ripples through the Bucha community. The soldier\u2019s rampage was not an isolated event. Nine soldiers from a unit based in the same wooded neighborhood have been charged in one of the first war crimes cases to reach court in Ukraine. The case centers on their cruel treatment of a civilian, an electrical engineer who was repeatedly detained and beaten in the last days of March. The engineer, Serhiy Kybka, is losing his sight from injuries suffered in another severe beating he received later, by a Russian soldier who encountered him on the street after his release. More than 450 people died in Bucha in one month, which was roughly 10 percent of the remaining population, a level that war crimes investigators say could amount to the crime of genocide.

  "2025-04-27_1777_1": "Supported by The Bruins had won an N.H.L.-best 65 games in the regular season and taken a 3-1 series lead, but the Panthers stunned them in Game 7 to eliminate Boston in the first round. These Boston Bruins have not been accustomed to losing streaks. They tore through the N.H.L. during the regular season, winning 65 games, a single-season record; claiming the Presidents\u2019 Trophy with a league-high of 135 points, 22 points clear of every other team; and outscoring their opponents by 128 goals. But after all that winning, a three-game losing streak, just their second of the season, came at an inopportune time. The Florida Panthers defeated the Bruins, 4-3, in overtime of Game 7 of their first-round playoff series on Sunday night in Boston to complete a rare comeback from a 3-1 series deficit. And they did so against some of the most formidable opposition in the league\u2019s 106-year history: The Bruins had 43 more points than the Panthers did in the regular season. Boston had been so dominant that on Saturday night, after Toronto beat Tampa Bay to win a postseason series for the first time since 2004, some fans of the Maple Leafs gathered outside the team\u2019s arena and chanted, \u201cWe want Florida.\u201d They got their wish. Carter Verhaeghe, a member of Tampa Bay\u2019s 2020 championship team, clinched the series with a left-handed shot from the right face-off dot through a screen by Matthew Tkachuk.  The Panthers built a 2-0 lead early in the second period, inciting a smattering of boos from an antsy Boston crowd. The Bruins scored three consecutive goals and looked poised to advance, but defenseman Brandon Montour forced overtime by scoring his second goal of the game with less than a minute left, and the goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky was sent to the bench for an extra attacker.

  "2025-04-27_602974_1": "Supported by Laura Kavanagh, the first woman to lead the New York Fire Department, demoted several officials. In return, they accused her of putting residents at risk. Few thought it would be easy when Laura Kavanagh took the reins of the nation\u2019s largest fire department in November as its first female leader. Most of the 33 men who had run the New York Fire Department, dating back to 1883, were older, with an up-through-the-ranks pedigree. But Ms. Kavanagh, 40, was the youngest in over a century. She had an Ivy League degree, but was not a native of New York, a background that has long been assumed as a prerequisite. And, though she had been a civilian department official for years, she had never been a member of a fire company. This week, in a kind of culmination of Ms. Kavanagh\u2019s tumultuous early tenure, four of her top chiefs filed a lawsuit against her and the department that took aim at her experience, repeatedly leaning on the same phrase: \u201cNever a day as a firefighter.\u201d The suit claims that three of the officials were unfairly demoted, putting New Yorkers at risk. Ms. Kavanagh on Tuesday evening dismissed that idea. \u201cWe are putting together a new team, and that\u2019s always difficult, but it\u2019s also what every commissioner before me has done,\u201d she told Fox 5 News. Ms. Kavanagh was named to her job by Mayor Eric Adams with great fanfare last year in a speech that made clear he considered her appointment a historic moment.

Follow our live updates of the Super Bowl between Philadelphia and Kansas City. A new work by the artist who recently unveiled a much-discussed sculpture of a hug between the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King will be displayed outside the Phoenix-area stadium hosting the upcoming Super Bowl. The 10-foot-tall stainless steel sculpture by the artist, Hank Willis Thomas, shows an unidentified player\u2019s extended arm reaching to catch a football. Titled \u201cOpportunity (reflection),\u201d it draws inspiration from his 2015 sculpture \u201cOpportunity.\u201d \u201cThe ball is a metaphor for the present moment and what we do with it,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIn team sports, it\u2019s all about what the collective does with the present moment toward achieving a goal against sometimes unlikely and unseemly odds.\u201d The sculpture was commissioned by the N.F.L. and will be displayed outside State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., on Feb. 12, the day the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs face off in Super Bowl LVII. (Fans can get an earlier view of the sculpture inside the Phoenix Convention Center; the work will later be on loan at the Arizona State University Art Museum.) In January, Thomas\u2019s 19-ton bronze monument to the Kings \u2014 inspired by a photo of the couple after Dr. King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 \u2014 was criticized and mocked online.

Seneca Scott, a cousin of Mrs. King, wrote an essay that described the work as \u201crather insulting.\u201d\u00a0But Thomas pointed out that the sculpture was meaningful to the Kings\u2019 descendants, including Yolanda Renee King, the civil rights leader\u2019s granddaughter, who called the work \u201clove 360.\u201d After the backlash, Martin Luther King III said on CNN that he was moved by the depiction of his parents.

ATLANTA \u2014 The Georgia Bulldogs appeared very nearly finished, just as they had looked for much of Saturday night. Adonai Mitchell had caught a touchdown in the final minute of the Peach Bowl, one of the College Football Playoff\u2019s semifinal showdowns, and Georgia had a lead of one measly point over Ohio State. But here were the Buckeyes, the No. 4 seed that had slid into the playoff after a debacle of a loss to Michigan, at the line of scrimmage and preparing to try a field goal to win. The perpetual clock neared midnight Eastern time and the start of 2023. The clock that mattered more here, though, showed eight seconds, and the uprights stood 50 yards away, the kind of cruel distance that promised to leave one team a championship contender and the other an also-ran. The snap came. Noah Ruggles swung his right leg, and then the ball swung wide to the left. The triumph of the comeback ordeal \u2014 and it was very much an ordeal for the 79,330 people inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta \u2014 would belong to Georgia, and Georgia alone. The Bulldogs won, 42-41, to advance to the national championship game against No. 3 Texas Christian, which toppled second-ranked Michigan in the Fiesta Bowl. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play our best football game \u2014 a lot of that had to do with Ohio State,\u201d said Georgia Coach Kirby Smart, who added, \u201cIf we want any chance at winning a national championship, we have to play a lot better football than we played tonight.\u201d Indeed, the Bulldogs, like the Horned Frogs of T.C.U., have much to consider between now and their meeting in California on Jan. 9. Perhaps most urgently, Georgia will need to figure out where and how its vaunted defense, which entered the Peach Bowl having allowed opponents about 292 yards a game, went wrong enough to surrender 467.

  "2025-04-27_43299_1": "Supported by A proposal by Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida to overhaul higher education would mandate courses in Western civilization, eliminate diversity programs and reduce the protections of tenure. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, as he positions himself for a run for president next year, has become an increasingly vocal culture warrior, vowing to take on liberal orthodoxy and its champions, whether they are at Disney, on Martha\u2019s Vineyard or in the state\u2019s public libraries. But his crusade has perhaps played out most dramatically in classrooms and on university campuses. He has banned instruction about gender identity and sexual orientation in kindergarten through third grade, limited what schools and employers can teach about racism and other aspects of history and rejected math textbooks en masse for what the state called \u201cindoctrination.\u201d Most recently, he banned the College Board\u2019s Advanced Placement courses in African American studies for high school students. On Tuesday, Governor DeSantis, a Republican, took his most aggressive swing yet at the education establishment, announcing a proposed overhaul of the state\u2019s higher education system that would eliminate what he called \u201cideological conformity.\u201d If enacted, courses in Western civilization would be mandated, diversity and equity programs would be eliminated, and the protections of tenure would be reduced. His plan for the state\u2019s education system is in lock step with other recent moves \u2014 banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, shipping a planeload of Venezuelan migrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard and stripping Disney, a once politically untouchable corporate giant in Florida, of favors it has enjoyed for half a century. His pugilistic approach was rewarded by voters who re-elected him by a 19 percentage-point margin in November. Appearing on Tuesday at the State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota, one of the state\u2019s 28 publicly funded state and community colleges, Mr. DeSantis vowed to turn the page on agendas that he said were \u201chostile to academic freedom\u201d in Florida\u2019s higher education system.

In the third week of brutal fighting in Sudan, health care services are rapidly unraveling in the nation\u2019s capital, Khartoum. Hospitals have been shelled, and two-thirds of those in Khartoum have closed, according to the W.H.O. More than a dozen health care workers have been killed, officials say, and basic medical services have become scarce. The fighting that erupted April 15 between a paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Army \u2014 both led by opposing generals \u2014 has left more than 500 people dead and thousands of others hurt, the W.H.O. says. The violence has thrown Africa\u2019s third-largest nation into chaos, as one declared cease-fire after another has collapsed. The latest truce to allow civilians to escape was to end at midnight last night, and though the R.S.F. said it would extend a humanitarian cease-fire for three more days, fighting was reported in the capital. The Sudanese Army has accused the R.S.F. of violating the truce and of occupying a hospital. The R.S.F., in turn, has said the army has been looting medical supplies.

SATURDAY PUZZLE \u2014 If a puzzle like this one makes you wonder who makes the rules around here, well, Wyna Liu and Joel Fagliano make up at least 20 percent of The New York Times\u2019s crossword nerve center. Individually, they\u2019re constructors of wide repute, but this is their first collaboration; they had tried before, apparently, but their schedules never lined up. To work around that, they agreed to split things up in an interesting way: Ms. Liu composed an entire clue set, Mr. Fagliano constructed a grid full of peppy entries, and then a neutral party reconciled the two halves. What are the chances? Zero, I\u2019m only joking. There are still several wild coincidences in this grid that will give you a distinct sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. 16A/11D. All kidding aside, there was a Natick here that stumped me.

The MythBuster is ADAM SAVAGE, and the daughter is EVIE (I chose \u201cEdie\u201d here, at first). 34A. Wait a minute! What day is it? Both are utterances that would answer this clue, \u201cCry heard on April Fools\u2019 Day,\u201d if they had fit. Since it\u2019s the date of this puzzle\u2019s publication, the entry here is \u201cWyna n Joel.\u201d Oh, wait. It\u2019s APRIL FOOL. 36A. The \u201cExperience of feeling unfamiliar with something that\u2019s actually quite familiar to you\u201d is the opposite of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, or \u201calready seen\u201d: JAMAIS VU, or \u201cnever seen.\u201d This is a debut; both terms are borrowed from the French (and never to be returned). There\u2019s another, related term that ought to resonate with weekend crossword solvers: Presque vu, or \u201calmost seen,\u201d is when you know you know something, but you just don\u2019t know what it is (and you also just know that you will know it at 3 a.m., or when it\u2019s too late for it to matter, whichever is more annoying). 51A. \u201cArt pieces that date back to the Han dynasty\u201d refers to WOODCUTS, also known as block printing, in which carved wood is used to transfer dyes to fabric to make prints. 2D. This \u201cWord that means the same thing even with letters added\u201d is a pun clue for a MAILBOX. What is a MAILBOX? A MAILBOX is a stumpy metal receptacle that\u2019s meant to receive correspondence on paper, or \u201cletters,\u201d usually from people of a certain age. Perhaps you have rested your latte on one when sending a quick email or watching a TikTok while waiting for a traffic light to change. 13D. \u201cNumber one fans?\u201d is another pun clue, for people who think \u201clooking out for number one\u201d means heading toward the nearest mirror \u2014 in a word, EGOISTS.

The phrase \u201caffordability crisis\u201d has become a part of everyday conversation, and no wonder: New York City seems more expensive than ever. Half the households in the city cannot afford to live here. The report detailing that jarring finding, from the Fund for the City of New York, came days after Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s ambitious plan for addressing the state\u2019s housing shortage unraveled amid objections from suburban communities on Long Island and in Westchester County. At the same time, the outlook for the city\u2019s economy is increasingly clouded by remote work, with whole floors of Manhattan office buildings vacated by corporate tenants that need less space as more employees do their jobs from home. I talked with my colleague Eliza Shapiro about the affordability crisis and the report from the Fund. This was disturbing but not really surprising, was it? Totally. What the report told us was something that New Yorkers are living with every day, which is that everything about living here has gotten harder except for the megarich. The report showed how hard it is for people to make rent, to comfortably afford housing and buy food, to say nothing of planning for the future or putting money away. This report put hard data and numbers to the reality that people are already living. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

The Court is skeptical because even if Defendant is correct, the Statute seems to be overly-broad. For a time, place, and manner restriction, it provides no time and manner restrictions. Its place restriction fares little better as it can be reasonably read to mean just about anywhere, including private homes.",

The Court does not take such actions lightly. But within our country's federal framework, states are laboratories of democracy that can test laws and policies enacted by The People. Even still, these experiments are not without constraints. The United States Constitution a law that is supreme even to the Tennessee General Assembly's acts-has placed some issues beyond the reach of the democratic process. First among them is the freedom of speech. If Tennessee wishes to exercise its police power in restricting speech it considers obscene, it must do so within the constraints and framework of the United States Constitution.

But Mr. Musk\u2019s Twitter feed is often an echo chamber. He regularly sees, likes and replies to messages that are about him or are posted from accounts that often act as his cheerleaders, according to a New York Times review of his activity on the platform.\n \n\tIn order to assess how the social network may evolve under Mr. Musk\u2019s watch, The Times reviewed nearly 20,000 of his public tweets, analyzing posts from recent years and images he published over the past decade, as well as the relatively small number of users that he follows.\n \n\tWhat Mr. Musk says on Twitter has a huge reach, now more than ever: His audience is one of the largest, with nearly 128 million accounts following him. It is where he solicits advice, conducts polls, condemns censorship and announces sweeping policy changes on the platform. As a power user who now controls the company \u2014 he recently called himself the \u201cchief twit\u201d \u2014 Mr. Musk has vowed to remake the social network in his vision.\n \n\tOf the 177 accounts that Mr. Musk followed as of this week, most were related to his businesses, or have expressed admiration of his business style, the Times review found. The list is heavily male: Only two dozen that are not institutional or organizational accounts belong to women. He is related to two of them \u2014 his mother, Maye, and sister, Tosca \u2014 and was married to a third.\n \n\tAmid discussions of Twitter policies, internet satellites from SpaceX and Tesla software updates, his posts have a freewheeling quality to them. He traffics in juvenile humor and vulgar jokes (pictures of tape dispensers laid in sexual positions), scientific marvels (the Large Hadron Collider), popular subjects on far-right sites (Pepe the Frog) and critiques of divisive cultural issues (\u201cI\u2019m not brainwashed!!\u201d).\n \n\tMr. Musk\u2019s posting style is conversational, and regularly satirical. He messages with former Democratic cabinet officials, criticizes news organizations and trades barbs with venture capitalists.\n \n\t\u201cThe purchasing of Twitter was a power move, politically,\u201d said Joan Donovan, the research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard. \u201cHe is one of the richest men in the world buying a social media company in a move that is expressly about politics and influence on culture and on media.\u201d\n \n\tOften, his updates are limited to just memes \u2014 joking images or videos that are copied and widely shared. Many have origins on fringe sites or cryptocurrency message boards that are popular with his followers. Some are about him. Some appear to be original.\n Through the end of 2022, Mr. Musk shared 1,181 images on Twitter. Through the end of 2022, Mr. Musk shared 1,181 images on Twitter. Since October 2018, at least 47 percent of them have been memes. They are highlighted here.

  "2025-04-27_428319_1": "Supported by Ross Douthat Opinion Columnist The first pope to resign was Celestine V, born Pietro Da Morrone, who was living the life of a pious hermit when he was elevated to the papacy in 1294, in his 80s, to break a two-year deadlock in the College of Cardinals. Feeling overmastered by the job, he soon resigned in the expectation that he could return to his monastic existence. Instead, he was imprisoned by his successor, Boniface VIII, who feared that some rival faction might make Celestine an antipope. The former pontiff died after about a year in captivity; his successor, one of the most ambitious of medieval popes, eventually fell into a disastrous struggle with the king of France that ended with Boniface temporarily imprisoned in the weeks before his death. The strange afterlife of Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s pontificate, which ended with his death on Saturday at 95, was not quite so wild or dramatic. But like Celestine\u2019s experience, it was not exactly an advertisement for papal resignations. For almost a decade, the former Joseph Ratzinger played a peculiar and poorly defined role as pope emeritus, neither fully secluded nor formally active, even as his successor, Francis, sought to dismantle important parts of Benedict\u2019s work. The former pope promised to live out his days \u201chidden from the world\u201d and presumably expected to see his legacy secure. Instead, he conducted a postpapacy of ambiguous gestures in response to a Vatican that had been delivered, by the mysteries of God\u2019s providence, to his longtime foes. Looking back to what I wrote upon his retirement in 2013 is an odd experience, because much of that analysis ceased to apply within just a few years of the resignation. At the time, I argued that Benedict, as pope and earlier as John Paul II\u2019s doctrinal chief, had worked tirelessly to prevent the ruptures that followed the Second Vatican Council \u2014 the collapse of Mass attendance in the Western world, the wars over liturgy and sexual ethics \u2014 from breaking up the Roman Catholic Church. A great theologian, part of the brilliant generation that advised the bishops at Vatican II, he put his brilliance in the service of continuity \u2014 offering a sustained reassertion of the church\u2019s core beliefs, a defense of traditional piety against academic revisionists, a lifelong argument that the Second Vatican Council hadn\u2019t simply overwritten the church that existed for centuries before.

  "2025-04-27_830350_1": "Supported by A federal judge put a hold on the law hours before it was to take effect, saying there were legitimate questions about whether it violated the First Amendment. NASHVILLE \u2014 A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the implementation of a Tennessee law aimed at restricting public drag performances, hours before it was set to go into effect. A Memphis theater company that frequently stages drag performances, Friends of George\u2019s, challenged the law this week, arguing that the ambiguity of the law violated the theater\u2019s constitutional rights. Violators of the law would be charged with a misdemeanor, or a felony for continued offenses. The measure, passed by the Republican-dominated legislature and signed into law on March 1, was set to go into effect on Saturday. It makes no explicit mention of drag but forbids \u201cadult cabaret\u201d and performances on public property by topless, go-go or exotic dancers, strippers, or male or female impersonators that are \u201charmful to minors.\u201d But the murkiness of the language, paired with a concerted effort among conservative lawmakers across the country to limit the rights of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, had raised concerns about the implications for drag performers and transgender and gender-nonconforming people. Judge Thomas L. Parker agreed to delay the law\u2019s implementation for at least 14 days, acknowledging that the company\u2019s concerns about upcoming performances \u2014 whether to impose an age restriction or risk legal scrutiny \u2014 were not \u201ctrifling issues for a theater company \u2014 certainly not in the free, civil society we hold our country to be.\u201d \u201cIf Tennessee wishes to exercise its police power in restricting speech it considers obscene, it must do so within the constraints and framework of the United States Constitution,\u201d Judge Parker wrote in the order. \u201cThe court finds that as it stands, the record here suggests that when the legislature passed this statute, it missed the mark.\u201d Judge Thomas L. Parker agreed to delay the implementation of a law limiting drag performance in Tennessee for at least 14 days. Judge Parker was appointed by former President Donald J. Trump and unanimously confirmed to the District Court for the Western District of Tennessee in 2018. Spokeswomen for Steven J. Mulroy, the district attorney for Shelby County, which includes Memphis, and Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, did not immediately return requests for comment on Friday. Mr. Mulroy did not oppose the request for a temporary order. In its suit, the theater company had highlighted the global history of drag performances, from the male actors who performed female roles in plays by William Shakespeare to American vaudeville productions. It also pointed to a successful effort by Representative Chris Todd, a Republican state legislator, to restrict a drag performance at a Pride parade in Jackson, Tenn., last year, and noted that several organizations had already dropped plans to host drag events as part of Pride celebrations this year because of the law. \u201cWe won because this is a bad law,\u201d said Mark Campbell, the president of the board of directors for the theater company, in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to our day in court where the rights for all Tennesseans will be affirmed.\u201d The theater is set to open \u201cDrag Rocks,\u201d billed as a mixture of comedy and drag performances, on April 14.

  "2025-04-27_10894_1": "Russia-Ukraine War Supported by The battle in the eastern Ukraine city of Bakhmut is growing in importance, as both sides pour forces into the battle. Russian forces are ratcheting up pressure on the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, pouring in waves of fighters to break Ukraine\u2019s resistance and targeting supply lines in a bloody campaign aimed at securing Moscow\u2019s first significant battlefield victory in months. Eleven months after Moscow launched its invasion, Bakhmut and the areas around it have become a center of intense fighting, with growing importance as both sides add forces to the battle. Russia intensified its effort to capture Bakhmut, which may be key to seizing the entire Donbas area, after months of bombardment beginning in the summer yielded few gains. \u201cThe situation is very tough,\u201d the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in a recent nightly address after meeting with military leaders. He said, \u201cThere are constant attempts to break through our defense.\u201d Over the course of the war, firepower has proved critical to Russian gains, but the battle for Bakhmut has been different. Increasingly, Ukrainian fighters and analysts say, Moscow has been relying on a cruder tactic: trying to tip the city into its win column through the sheer weight of troop numbers. As a result, the Ukrainians say, Russian casualties in recent fighting in Bakhmut have been higher than in previous months. Part of Russia\u2019s evolving strategy appears to be to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses with waves of soldiers, many drawn from President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s call-up of 300,000 men in September. That would be a departure from Moscow\u2019s summer campaigns elsewhere in the Donbas, when artillery pounded cities for weeks before Russia launched a sustained ground offensive.

  "2025-04-27_725241_1": "Supported by The Gamecocks were considered a heavy favorite to repeat as champions. But Clark and the Hawkeyes delivered, all the way to the championship game against Louisiana State. Reporting from the Final Four in Dallas Many thought that South Carolina winning the national championship this year was a forgone conclusion. Louisiana State\u2019s coach Kim Mulkey told reporters after L.S.U.\u2019s round-of-8 win that South Carolina was \u201cgoing to be there\u201d in the championship game. South Carolina had been undefeated, was dominating teams all season and was the reigning champion. But the Gamecocks had not played a player like Caitlin Clark. On Friday night, Clark and Iowa managed to do what no other team has done, downing South Carolina, 77-73, to make their way to the program\u2019s first championship game \u2014 delivering the upset of all upsets in a March that has been filled with them. South Carolina, before the tournament began, had been the odds-on favorite to win another championship, to burnish the program\u2019s claim to be the newest dynasty in women\u2019s college basketball. Instead it was Iowa, perhaps understandably, that celebrated like it had won the championship when the game was over. Clark, who finished with 41 points, 8 assists and 6 rebounds, ran around the arena with a hand to her ear before stopping and raising both of her arms as Iowa\u2019s white-knuckled fans roared. The team hugged and cheered at midcourt, and the players sang the school\u2019s fight song with fans. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-27_971380_1": "Supported by Bryant, the widow of the basketball star Kobe Bryant, sued Los Angeles County after some of its employees shared graphic photos of the crash that killed her husband and one of their daughters. Los Angeles County agreed to pay Vanessa Bryant and three of her daughters nearly $30 million to settle a lawsuit and potential claims over the sharing of graphic photos of the January 2020 helicopter crash that killed Bryant\u2019s husband, the basketball star Kobe Bryant, and one of their daughters, according to a court filing on Tuesday. The settlement includes $15 million a jury awarded Vanessa Bryant in August, with additional funds to settle potential claims from her daughters. \u201cToday marks the successful culmination of Mrs. Bryant\u2019s courageous battle to hold accountable those who engaged in this grotesque conduct,\u201d Luis Li, Bryant\u2019s lawyer, said in a statement. \u201cShe fought for her husband, her daughter, and all those in the community whose deceased family were treated with similar disrespect. We hope her victory at trial and this settlement will put an end to this practice.\u201d On Jan. 26, 2020, Kobe Bryant, 41, and his daughter Gianna Bryant, 13, were in a helicopter with seven other people when it crashed in foggy conditions outside Los Angeles, killing all on board. Soon after, Vanessa Bryant learned that some employees of the county\u2019s fire and sheriff\u2019s departments had shared graphic photos of human remains from the crash. She sued for negligence and invasion of privacy in September 2020 and won at trial in August, providing a rare and expensive public admonition of some of Los Angeles\u2019 most powerful institutions. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay Bryant\u2019s family $28.85 million to settle Bryant\u2019s lawsuit and potential future claims by Bryant and her daughters: Natalia, 20, Bianka, 6, and Capri, 3. The jury in August awarded Bryant $16 million, which was later reduced by $1 million because of a clerical error. In a statement, Mira Hashmall, the lead trial counsel for Los Angeles County in Bryant\u2019s case, called the settlement \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d and said all county-related litigation from the crash had been resolved. \u201cWe hope Ms. Bryant and her children continue to heal from their loss,\u201d Hashmall said. Kobe Bryant, who starred for the Los Angeles Lakers for 20 years before retiring in 2016, was on his way to coach Gianna\u2019s basketball team at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks, Calif., when they boarded the helicopter on the day of the crash. The pilot, Ara Zobayan, became disoriented in the clouds and crashed into a hill near Calabasas, Calif., killing all nine people on board. In a deposition for her lawsuit, Vanessa Bryant said Rob Pelinka, the Lakers\u2019 general manager and Kobe Bryant\u2019s former agent, drove her later that morning to a sheriff\u2019s station in Malibu, near the crash scene. Alex Villanueva, who was the Los Angeles County sheriff at the time, confirmed the deaths and asked Bryant if he could do anything for her, she said. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018If you can\u2019t bring my husband and baby back, please make sure that no one takes photographs of them. Please secure the area,\u2019\u201d Bryant said during the deposition. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018I will.\u2019 And I said: \u2018No, I need you to get on the phone right now and I need you to make sure you secure the area.\u2019\u201d Bryant testified at trial that she learned from a Los Angeles Times report that a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy had showed photos of the crash at a bar. The existence of the photos, Bryant said, compounded the tragedy. \u201cI live in fear of my daughters being on social media and these popping up,\u201d Bryant testified. The pictures were primarily shared between employees of the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s and fire departments. Lawyers for the county acknowledged that the photos were taken and shared, but argued that an immediate order to delete them kept them from being publicly disseminated. At the trial, the jury also awarded $15 million to Chris Chester, who joined the suit because his wife Sarah, 45, and daughter, Payton, 13, were killed in the crash. Los Angeles County agreed to pay the Chester family an additional $4.95 million to resolve any future claims. Two other families separately settled with the county over the photos for $1.25 million each in October 2021. Li previously said that Bryant would donate the proceeds from the lawsuit to her Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation, which honors Kobe and Gianna Bryant.

  "2025-04-27_634191_1": "Supported by Four officers charged in Tyre Nichols\u2019s death had been disciplined previously, including two who had failed to report using force during arrests. Two of the former Memphis police officers charged with killing Tyre Nichols had previously been reprimanded for failing to file required reports about the use of physical force in making arrests, according to records released Tuesday. In one case from 2019, Officer Desmond Mills Jr. was assisting with an arrest after a traffic stop when he grabbed the suspect by the arms and took her to the ground, personnel records show. After a hearing two years later, Mr. Mills was given a written reprimand for failing to file the mandatory incident report. The woman arrested in that case had filed a complaint alleging that she was beaten by officers, grabbed by the hair and slammed into a patrol car. The records describe body camera footage showing that two different officers had struggled with the woman for several minutes, with one of them striking her with a baton, before Mr. Mills and others stepped in to assist. The woman \u201csustained bruises and abrasions during the struggle,\u201d the records say. Demetrius Haley, another one of the officers charged in Mr. Nichols\u2019s death, was also reprimanded in 2021 for failing to file a report after grabbing someone by the arm to turn them around to make an arrest. Mr. Haley said at a hearing that he had been mistaken about \u201cthe amount of force necessary to require\u201d such documentation. The personnel files were released on the eve of Mr. Nichols\u2019s funeral, which was scheduled for Wednesday with the Rev. Al Sharpton set to deliver the eulogy. At a news conference on Tuesday evening, Mr. Sharpton, flanked by Mr. Nichols\u2019s family and civil rights activists, reiterated demands for accountability. He called for changes in federal law that would tighten rules on police conduct and make it easier to sue officers accused of wrongdoing, describing what happened to Mr. Nichols as \u201ca disgrace to this country.\u201d Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

ASTANA, Kazakhstan \u2014 Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken came to Central Asia to press his case that the region should hold the line against Russian efforts to seek economic aid as Moscow grapples with Western sanctions. Within hours of landing in Astana, the snow-draped capital of Kazakhstan, he received a sign that the United States had some leverage. The Kazakh president stood next to Mr. Blinken in the blue-domed presidential palace and thanked the Americans for their support of his nation\u2019s \u201cindependence, territorial integrity and sovereignty.\u201d The president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has not criticized Russia\u2019s war, and neither have leaders of the four other Central Asian nations, former Soviet republics with decades-long ties with Moscow. But his pointed statement suggested that, after the invasion of Ukraine, also a former Soviet republic, there was concern that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could try to seize parts of their own nations or encourage separatists. Parts of northern Kazakhstan are inhabited largely by ethnic Russians and are viewed by Russian nationalists as territory that should belong to Russia. So there is concern that those Kazakh residents could fall victim to Mr. Putin\u2019s logic that Moscow has a duty to \u201cprotect\u201d ethnic kin wherever they are. Mr. Blinken quickly gave assurances, saying at a news conference later that the United States was a committed partner of the Central Asian nations and that \u201cour support for their independence and sovereignty, their territorial integrity, is real.\u201d His remarks came after a group meeting with the foreign ministers of the five Central Asian nations. Mr. Blinken\u2019s visit to Kazakhstan was the first by a Biden administration cabinet official to any Central Asian nation. It occurs at an important moment in American efforts to rally nations to buttress Ukraine in preparation for its defense against a broader Russian offensive expected this spring and for Kyiv\u2019s own potential military push.

The university\u2019s ambitions are relatively young, too. HOUSTON \u2014 David Vanterpool has played professional basketball in Italy, China, and Russia and coached in the N.B.A., yet even he was surprised on his first visit to Florida Atlantic University. Vanterpool, who most recently served as an assistant coach with the Nets during the 2021-22 season, first set foot on the school\u2019s 850-acre, palm-tree lined campus in Boca Raton, Fla., in January. He was on a recruiting visit with his son, Devin, a guard who is getting ready to graduate high school. It was a balmy 85 degrees, and they stayed at a nearby beachside hotel. (\u201cWinning in paradise\u201d is the school\u2019s marketing tagline, and \u201c1.8 miles to the beach\u201d is stamped on its arena floor.) \u201cI asked if they could add me to the scholarship they offered my son and put me in some masters courses or something like that,\u201d Vanterpool joked. Devin Vanterpool ended up verbally committing to Florida Atlantic on March 12, one day after the Owls won the Conference USA tournament, which earned them an automatic bid to the men\u2019s N.C.A.A. tournament. A few days later, Florida Atlantic started its current run of four wins in the national tournament to reach the Final Four. On Saturday night, the No. 9 seed Owls will meet No. 5-seeded San Diego State in a national semifinal, with the winner facing either Connecticut or Miami on Monday for the championship. The Vanterpools had a leg up on many others when it came to their familiarity with Florida Atlantic, a university many people had never heard of beyond a line in a March Madness bracket challenge. (Some basics: The team is named the Owls because the main campus is an owl sanctuary. It also sits on the former Boca Raton Army Air Field, which was used in World War II for radar training, well before the university officially opened in 1964.) Florida Atlantic\u2019s deep tournament run this year seemed to come out of nowhere. The team had only one previous tournament appearance, yet it has won 11 straight games.

  "2025-04-27_887210_1": "Trump Administration Supported by Fact Check The House debated for hours on Tuesday before voting for measures that would end a public health emergency and a vaccine mandate for some health care workers. WASHINGTON \u2014 As the House debated for hours over pandemic measures, Republican lawmakers on Tuesday repeatedly misled about the efficacy of vaccines, the rationale behind vaccine mandates and their effects. T\u200cwo measures, \u200cintroduced by Republicans, would end a vaccine mandate\u200c\u200c for \u200ccertain health care workers as well as the public health emergency declared at the start of the pandemic. The House\u200c \u200capproved the two \u200cbills, largely along party lines, on Tuesday\u200c. Still, they do not have the votes to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, let alone receive approval from President Biden. Here\u2019s a fact check of some of their remarks. What Was Said \u201cDr. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, said in August 2021, quote, \u2018What they can\u2019t do\u2019 \u2014 they being the vaccines \u2014 \u2018What they can\u2019t do anymore is prevent transmission.\u2019 The C.D.C.\u2019s own website says right now the vaccine does nothing for transmission.

Mr. Roy is referring to \u2014 and cherry-picking \u2014 comments made by Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about the agency\u2019s guidance on Covid-19 vaccines as well as the rationale behind the vaccine mandates for federal workers and certain health care professionals. In August 2021, when a surge in coronavirus cases caused by the more infectious Delta variant prompted the C.D.C. to encourage wearing masks in public again, Dr. Walensky appeared on CNN to explain the updated guidance. Asked about \u201cbreakthrough cases\u201d \u2014 fully vaccinated people who nonetheless catch the virus \u2014 Dr. Walensky stressed the importance of inoculation despite the fact that the vaccines did not appear to prevent breakthrough infections.

This year\u2019s team, with three key holdovers, has made a run to the Final Four. SAN DIEGO \u2014 What once appeared to be the apex of the history of the San Diego State men\u2019s basketball program occurred just over three years ago. After a 26-0 start, the Aztecs were 30-2, ranked sixth in the Associated Press poll and projected to be seeded No. 1 or 2 in the N.C.A.A. tournament. They were well on their way toward fulfilling the shared vision of Steve Fisher and Brian Dutcher, the two men whose brilliant construction reversed the course of a program that for decades was known for chronic underachievement. Then the 2020 tournament was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Everyone went home, sad and scared. \u201cSometimes we take for granted just going and losing in the first round,\u201d Dutcher, who is in his sixth season as the Aztecs\u2019 head coach after 27 years assisting Fisher at Michigan and San Diego State, said recently. \u201cJust to have a chance to play would have meant the world to those guys.\u201d Schools like San Diego State usually do not get a second chance to catch a dream. That is what makes its surge in this year\u2019s N.C.A.A. tournament both remarkable and inspiring. And the Aztecs are not taking a second for granted. Set to face Florida Atlantic in a national semifinal Saturday in Houston, San Diego State is not only in its first Final Four, it also is the first Mountain West Conference team to advance this far.

Credit...Photo Illustrations by Yasara Gunawardena For The New York Times Supported by Some chapters of life attract advice. After a breakup, friends who are typically silent about your romances might urge you to get back on dating apps and block your ex on social media. Starting a family gives rise to opinions about prenatal vitamins and stroller brands; interviewing for a new job might prompt advice about salary negotiations and work-life balance. Recently, I entered a suggestion-heavy era. A long relationship had ended, and I pondered leaving my job and moving to a different neighborhood. Suddenly, I was in need of input from others on how to find a new laundromat, enroll in health insurance as a freelancer, live alone and navigate online dating. I wanted practical guidance that I could quickly put into effect in my life. But the immediate value of suggestions, I learned, wasn\u2019t simply doing what others said. They can be a tool for self-discovery, a mirror to reflect on our beliefs and blind spots. Input from others elicits the opportunity to think something over. By determining if it is something we want, and if it matches our desires or values, we\u2019re forced to name what our desires and values are in the first place. As I became more receptive to advice, I stumbled on another person seeking suggestions in a surprising way. In the fall, the University of Chicago philosopher Agnes Callard, who specializes in ancient philosophy and ethics and is known for her popular essays on philosophy, created a virtual suggestion box. Dr. Callard often receives suggestions on Twitter and wanted a centralized place to collect them. A link in her bio takes users to a Google form, prompting them to answer the question: \u201cHow should I improve?\u201d So far, Dr. Callard has received plenty of suggestions for what to read and write. Recently, she followed a suggestion to read a sermon by Herbert McCabe, the theologian, and said she liked its exploration of the relationship between prayer and self-knowledge.

  "2025-04-27_176801_1": "Supported by wordplay, the crossword column Aaron M. Rosenberg\u2019s puzzle is royally fun. Jump to: Tricky Clues | Today\u2019s Theme WEDNESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Congratulations to Aaron M. Rosenberg, who is making his third appearance in the New York Times Crossword. Solvers with an interest in crossword construction should take a look at Mr. Rosenberg\u2019s constructor notes, which provide valuable insight into theme creation. Sometimes, just a thought is all it takes to set off the creative process! Constructors with coding chops, like Mr. Rosenberg, can turn that spark of inspiration into a fully formed theme in no time. We\u2019ll get into Mr. Rosenberg\u2019s hilarious theme in a moment, but first, let\u2019s look at some of the clues that stood out in today\u2019s puzzle. 1A. I was immediately hooked by the clue \u201cLike some plants that don\u2019t need watering.\u201d I am developing my green thumb, and I would love to have a plant or two that doesn\u2019t need watering. Of course, that was before I realized that the answer was FAKE. (Raise your hand if you ever watered a fake plant for months before you realized it was fake. Just me? Ah, well.) 20A. The \u201cApt recourse for a deal gone sour?\u201d is a LEMON LAW, which may cover you if you purchase a faulty car. 34A. \u201c___ Day (Down Under holiday)\u201d is the clue for ANZAC, an acronym for the \u201cAustralian and New Zealand Army Corps.\u201d I had never heard of ANZAC Day, which commemorates the day that Australian and New Zealand forces landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula in what is now Turkey on April 25, 1915, during World War I. The day later broadened to honor the lives of all Australians and New Zealanders who died in service. 63A. NEON is an \u201cElement of the Vegas strip?\u201d The Vegas strip is famously bedecked in NEON lights. 6D. One \u201cExperimental-but-accessible music genre\u201d is AVANT-POP. I appreciate that each element of the answer is inferable from the clue: \u201cExperimental\u201d gives us the AVANT bit, while \u201caccessible\u201d points to POP. 11D. I enjoyed this interview with Ted CHIANG (\u201cAward-winning science fiction writer Ted\u201d), so I thought I\u2019d share that with you here. 37D. We see a lot of French in crossword puzzles, but this is the first time we\u2019ve ever seen PAPILLON clued with \u201cFrench for \u2018butterfly\u2019\u201d instead of the dog breed in the New York Times Crossword. 55D. \u201cIt\u2019s just a thought\u201d is the clue for IDEA. In this case, the \u201cit\u201d in the clue refers to the entry \u2014 an IDEA is just a thought. This puzzle features four common phrases ending in KING that have been reparsed to be about four very silly monarchs. Each of the KINGs has a very particular quirk, which is described in detail in extra-long, extra-absurd clues. First is the PERSONAL BAN KING (\u201cHark! And hear of the vengeful ruler who took great pleasure in expelling disloyal subjects, for he was the \u2026\u201d). Of course, \u201cpersonal banking\u201d is a coherent concept that is in-the-language, but PERSONAL BAN KING is so much funnier. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to use an A.T.M. or deposit a check through my phone without thinking about this petty ruler. The next ridiculous monarch is the CHERRY PIC KING (\u201cListen now! And I shall relate the story of the curious sovereign who adorned his castle with images of red fruit, for he was the \u2026\u201d). His castle, adorned with CHERRY PICs, sounds lovely. Our third peculiar potentate is the DOUBLE PAR KING (\u201cLend me your ear! And I will speak of the clumsy monarch who took twice as many golf strokes as his opponents, for he was the \u2026\u201d). As a poor golfer myself, I most relate to the DOUBLE PAR KING. Finally, and perhaps most absurdly, we have the BACKWARD LOO KING (\u201cGive heed! And listen to my tale of the mad tyrant who decreed that all toilets in his realm be installed the wrong way, for he was the \u2026\u201d). I laughed out loud at this one, and then had a fun time trying to imagine how one would use a BACKWARD LOO. This is a ridiculous, hilarious theme, and I immensely enjoyed solving it. Let\u2019s hear from Mr. Rosenberg about his (incredibly speedy) experience constructing it. The inspiration for this puzzle came from Carl Larson\u2019s \u201cQueen\u201d puzzle from 2021. I solved it just after 10 p.m. the night it came out and recall thinKING that I might be able to develop a theme around a different sort of monarch. I wrote a Python script to find words ending in KING that become nouns if you remove KING and sifted through the stems to search for viable entries. By 11 p.m., I had nailed down the theme set you see in today\u2019s crossword. Why did this one come together so quickly? Frankly, there weren\u2019t that many other options to choose from. If you have suggestions on how you would have clued MOUNTAIN BI KING, feel free to DM me on Twitter.

  "2025-04-27_381616_1": "Supported by In Arizona, where independents are a crucial voting bloc, there might not be the same sense of urgency for a Biden-Trump rematch. And some voters might look elsewhere. Reporting from Phoenix. Although Donald J. Trump has been out of office more than two years, receding as an all-consuming figure to many Americans, to Margot Copeland, a political independent, he looms as overwhelmingly as ever. She would just as urgently oppose Mr. Trump in a 2024 rematch with President Biden as she did the last time. \u201cI\u2019ll get to the polls and get everybody out to the polls too,\u201d said Ms. Copeland, a 67-year-old retiree who said she was aghast at the possible return to office of the 45th president. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that Trump does not get back in.\u201d At the same time, Andrew Dickey, also a political independent who supported Mr. Biden in 2020, said he was disappointed with the current president\u2019s record, particularly his failure to wipe out student debt. (The Supreme Court is considering Mr. Biden\u2019s debt forgiveness program, but appeared skeptical during a hearing.) Mr. Dickey, a chef, owes $20,000 for his culinary training. \u201cI think I would possibly vote third party,\u201d Mr. Dickey, 35, said of a Trump-Biden rematch. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of things said on Biden\u2019s end that haven\u2019t been met. It was the normal smoke screen of the Democrats promising all this stuff, and then nothing.\u201d In Maricopa County in Arizona, the most crucial county in one of the most important states on the 2024 electoral map, voters like Ms. Copeland and Mr. Dickey illustrate the electoral upside \u2014 and potential pitfalls \u2014 for Mr. Biden as he begins his bid for a second term, which he announced last week. The prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch in 2024 is Democrats\u2019 greatest get-out-the-vote advantage. But the yearning by some past Biden voters for an alternative, including a third-party candidate, poses a threat to the president. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

In the months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, politicians and activists have attempted to squeeze concrete answers from an eternal question of human existence: When does life begin?

  "2025-04-27_13177_1": "Supported by Jarrod Powell pleaded guilty to attacking Yao Pan Ma on an East Harlem street because the victim was of Asian descent. A man who admitted to brutally, and fatally, attacking a 61-year-old immigrant in East Harlem two years ago because the victim was Asian was sentenced to 22 years in prison on Friday. The sentencing of the man, Jarrod Powell, came several months after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter as a hate crime in the killing of the immigrant, Yao Pan Ma, according to prosecutors. Mr. Ma spent about eight months in a coma before dying as a result of the injuries he sustained in the attack. In entering his plea, according to prosecutors, Mr. Powell, 51, said he had targeted the older man because he was Asian. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.

  "2025-04-27_126623_1": "Supported by She had been a Manson family member and was along on the nights of the infamous Tate-LaBianca murders, but she became the prosecution\u2019s lead witness. Linda Kasabian, who stood lookout while other members of the Charles Manson family engaged in two nights of murder in 1969 and then, after an immunity deal, became a pivotal prosecution witness in the trials that put Mr. Manson and four of his other followers in prison, died on Jan. 21 in Tacoma, Wash. She was 73. A notice in The News Tribune of Tacoma recorded her death. It gave no cause. For the most part Ms. Kasabian had tried to keep a low profile since the killings and had gone under several names. At her death she was using the name Linda Chiochios. Ms. Kasabian had recently turned 20 in July 1969 when she left her husband, Robert Kasabian, and went to live on the Spahn Ranch, an old movie set in Los Angeles where Mr. Manson and his followers were camped out. \u201cWhen I left, I was searching for love and freedom,\u201d she said in a 2009 television documentary about the case, one of the few times she spoke publicly about it. \u201cI was searching for God.\u201d What she found was a commune where drugs and sex were plentiful and where Mr. Manson, a habitual criminal and frustrated musician, held a psychological grip on his followers. Mr. Manson harbored hateful ideas about Black people and sought to set off a race war, leading him to send Ms. Kasabian, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles Watson out on a murderous mission. In the early hours of Aug. 9, 1969, Ms. Kasabian waited at the car while the others killed five people, including the actress Sharon Tate, the wife of the director Roman Polanski, in Ms. Tate\u2019s Los Angeles home in hilly Benedict Canyon.
